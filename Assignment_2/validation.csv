"" he is well - deserving of an immediate promotion ( really more of a correction ) and pay raise , to be made retroactive at least to the lst of this month . this memo outlines the circumstances surrounding this hiring error and provides detailed justifications for this retroactive "" promotion . "" at the time of the interview process , there was no position in enron designated as "" professional meteorologist . "" in fact , the most recent similar hire prior to that date was jose marquez , also a professional meteorologist , who was hired in , based on salary alignment criteria , as a manager . while functionally , both these men are meteorologists , enron has no such job classification . compounded by the urgency in bringing on additional professional expertise in short time order , it was difficult to peg the proper enron classification appropriate for this new position . this original uncertainty and resulting misplacement of stephen into the specialist category , rather than the senior specialist category , needs to be corrected at this time . although a "" new - hire "" to enron , stephen bennett has extensive work experience . he has worked as a professional meteorologist at both the weather services corporation in boston and at the weather channel in atlanta . he came to enron well - referenced by both those organizations , needing no further training and only minimal supervision . once aboard here in houston , stephen immediately demonstrated the core enron values with our unique sense of urgency . after only a week , he assumed responsibilities normally reserved for someone actually at even a manager level - he was assigned and fully took over the critical afternoon weather briefings to the gas traders . this includes analysis and report preparation as well as presentation . also in the presentation arena , he now regularly briefs various desks in the morning and throughout the day . stephen is a master of communication and particularly adept at conveying what through other messengers might otherwise seem confusing or ambiguous . stephen has also demonstrated an unusually high level of self - initiative . he designed , implemented , and now maintains several sub - sites on the research web page which he tailored to various customers - in specific : the weather derivatives team , the agricultural team , and most recently , the crude and liquids team . i have recently assigned stephen to spearhead our conversion and major upgrade of this web page . these above described accomplishments are above and beyond stephen  , s regular duties which include starting work at 5 am daily , reliably and without fail , to assemble and prepare our trader  , s weather report . recently , with the advent of extended hours for both nymex and enrononline , stephen voluntarily on his own accord , assists in our new sunday weather support effort . as his supervisor , fully cognizant of his already standard 50 + hour work week , i do not solicit , but readily accept , this above and beyond expectations assistance . in review , the circumstance which resulted in this under hire condition was enron  , s immediate need for a non - standard , fairly unique professional - a meteorologist , coupled with stephen  , s desire to work for our company in spite of the absence of a hierarchy which included the exact entitled professional title reflecting his chosen career path . . once hired , stephen has clearly demonstrated through contribution and performance that he is well -

( f - pcr ) technology uses live animal blood to detect the presence of infectious diseases and for the development of vaccines for such blood born diseases . it also allows for the efficient , effective , and continuous testing , management and treatment of animal populations . these facts distinguish the technology from any alternative testing and management methodology available to agriculture today - - all of which require the destruction of individual animals and even entire herds . our testing and data analysis processes also allow us not only to separate infected from clean animals , but also to gain knowledge vital to development of preventative vaccines . to date , genethera has successfully developed the assay ability to detect mad cow and chronic wasting disease , a disease affecting elk and deer in north america . diagnostic assays for e . coli ol 57 : h 7 and johnne ' s disease are in the final stages of development . vaccines for e . coli ol 57 : h 7 and johnne ' s disease , both of which are diseases affecting cattle , are in advanced stages of development . in the future , the company plans to expand assay application research to a wide range of diseases / animals , the immediate targets being mad cow , hoof mouth , west nile and newcastle . genethera can detect bse using the companies patented live animal blood test that evaluates the e . d . r . f . gene sequence . the e . d . r . f . gene is proven to decrease dramatically before any tse infection is noticeable in a live animal or human . the patent gtha holds is broad based and can detect all tse diseases including mad cow ( bse ) in cattle , cwd in elk deer and creutzfeld - jacobs in humans the company ' s patented test can detect these diseases faster than any other method developed in the marketplace and at far less a cost . the test can also be used on a mass scale using roche f - pcr , dna analyzing robotics equipment . genethera can analyze over 2000 blood samples a day with one f - pcr machine and a single technician . the project will prove highly profitable at approx $ 4 . 00 per test when wide scale commercialization is under way . a multi - billion dollar , international demand for commercial mad cow testing has emerged around the globe . japan conducted 3 million post - mortem rapid mad cow tests last year alone . they used the western blot developed by prionics ag in swizterland and bio - rad ' s rapid test . costs are between $ 20 and $ 40 dollars per test . most importantly , other tests in the marketplace cannot detect the disease until the animal has been killed . testing through post - mortem brain tissue exams is extremely labor intensive and costly . japan spent between $ 60 million - $ 120 million on 3 million post mortem rapid mad cow tests in 2004 . genethera ' s simple blood test can be collected using their patented field collection system . the sample is then mailed to the lab for testing . the company also stated in their recent 10 k that they are currently in negotiations with strategic testing partners that we believe will absorb the costs of commercializing our live animal mad cow test . management : dr . tony

"re : progress steve , thanks a lot . i think that having the pseudo code will go a long way towards understanding how the system works and making sure that there are no bugs in translation of a business problem ( for example , complicated credit insurance deals with multiple triggers and conditionality ) into the code . regarding tanya ' s attitude . just a few points . 1 . i don ' t think she has the skills to do the system administrator ' s work and she does not have the necessary privileges . this explains why she keeps asking winston for help . it ' s not that the work is beneath her . 2 . some members of tanya ' s team came to me complaining about winston . he effectively told them to go away and work on the "" research projects "" and that he would take care of the it issues . i don ' t think that it ' s just tanya ' s issue , though i agree that a more outgoing personality would be helpful . 3 . the reality of this situation is that the internal customers beat on tanya and me whenever there is any performance problems and / or they intuitively disagree with the results of a run . they could not care less about the demarcation line between it and research . they also want tanya to sign off on the model and she cannot do it without full access to the code . the bottom line is that we are in full agreement : tanya and winston have to work as a team and i shall work on my end to make sure that it happens . credit is emerging as a critical issue for enron for the next few weeks and the system cannot fail . vince from : stephen stock / enron @ enronxgate on 01 / 11 / 2001 08 : 23 am to : vince j kaminski / hou / ect @ ect cc : subject : progress vince , i got feedback from the lunchtime research meeting that you were talking about some specific solutions to performance of it systems . . . in particular distributed processing . also i heard that you had concerns about the use of multiple languages etc . . . . both of these sound like what i was discussing with you on previous occasions . . . do you feel the need to discuss these further ? the multi - language issue isn ' t really that much of an issue , as the current system is 98 % java right now . although i am a big fan of c / c + + ( it is my main development skill ) , i am also very aware that java is a much more evolved and robust language . i had serious doubts about the performance , but i ' ve had a review conducted , and the results are showing the sun unix implementation to be nearly as fast and in some cases faster than c / c + + because of something they call hot - spot technology . ( its an instruction caching technique , i believe ) . the concerns i expressed to you , were really about how technical people justify the use of a language on the strength of a relatively meaningless metric like portability . on the issue of distributed processing . . . the original review i had conducted by our architecture group pointed to that as a solution , and as zhiyong wei is already working on global valuation project , winston is actively working with zhiyong to see if he can model the var architecture on that , and also to find a common valuation piece between the systems . i ' d like the opportunity to talk to you about these issues if you have some time over the next few days ? also , i sat in on the tanya / winston meeting yesterday and as per our discussion at the elevator , i attempted to help her argument by suggesting to all present that she was trying to perform triage on the code . . . i . e . seperating research domain problems from it problems . she said that stepping through code was the only real way in which she could get a feel for where performance bottlenecks were . i asked her how she would measure that , and she said she would instrument the code manually by inserting timing elements at strategic points . i mentioned that a profiling tool could probably do this job for her . tanya again said that stepping through code is the only way she can get an idea of the code , and that studying documentation wasn ' t enough . about 6 weeks ago , i commissioned a team to document the system down to psuedo - code level and will be able to provide this to you and your team soon . ( in fact i ' ve asked for a draft copy to be given to tanya right now ) , and winston is also working on a draft research / it "" working together "" document , which will identify how the exchange of information takes place . tanya also gave the impression that she wants a dedicated it developer to do all the environment setup for her , because she doesn ' t really want to have to do that . i think that this is probably the root cause of the issue . the it guys are working very hard and her handling of the situation is not good , as it gives the impression that this kind of work is beneath her . she is claiming that they are un - cooperative . . . . they are claiming that she continually asks the same questions about set - up over and over again , and doesn ' t seem to want to learn how to do it . winston on the other hand , could be more proactive in determining what is a business related model issue and an it issue and ask for help from research . i think you debbie and i need to work quite hard to get them to play nicely . i have asked tanya and winston to go ahead and work very closely together over the next few days . . . . and debbie brackett and i will review their progress on friday . in the meantime l ' ll be looking at setting up a working test environment that doesn ' t involve my main quant guys in day to to day setup issues as a longer term solution . regards steve",0,progress steve thanks lot think pseudo code go long way towards understanding system works making sure bugs translation business problem example complicated credit insurance deals multiple triggers conditionality code regarding tanya attitude points think skills system administrator work necessary privileges explains keeps asking winston help work beneath members tanya team came complaining winston effectively told go away work research projects would take care issues think tanya issue though agree outgoing personality would helpful reality situation internal customers beat tanya whenever performance problems intuitively disagree results run could care less demarcation line research also want tanya sign model without full access code bottom line full agreement tanya winston work team shall work end make sure happens credit emerging critical issue enron next weeks system fail vince stephen stock enron enronxgate vince j kaminski hou ect ect cc subject progress vince got feedback lunchtime research meeting talking specific solutions performance systems particular distributed processing also heard concerns use multiple languages etc sound like discussing previous occasions feel need discuss multi language issue really much issue current system java right although big fan c c main development skill also aware java much evolved robust language serious doubts performance review conducted results showing sun unix implementation nearly fast cases faster c c something call hot spot technology instruction caching technique believe concerns expressed really technical people justify use language strength relatively meaningless metric like portability issue distributed processing original review conducted architecture group pointed solution zhiyong wei already working global valuation project winston actively working zhiyong see model var architecture also find common valuation piece systems like opportunity talk issues time next days also sat tanya winston meeting yesterday per discussion elevator attempted help argument suggesting present trying perform triage code e seperating research domain problems problems said stepping code real way could get feel performance bottlenecks asked would measure said would instrument code manually inserting timing elements strategic points mentioned profiling tool could probably job tanya said stepping code way get idea code studying documentation enough weeks ago commissioned team document system psuedo code level able provide team soon fact asked draft copy given tanya right winston also working draft research working together document identify exchange information takes place tanya also gave impression wants dedicated developer environment setup really want think probably root cause issue guys working hard handling situation good gives impression kind work beneath claiming un cooperative claiming continually asks questions set seem want learn winston hand could proactive determining business related model issue issue ask help research think debbie need work quite hard get play nicely asked tanya winston go ahead work closely together next days debbie brackett review progress friday meantime l looking setting working test environment involve main quant guys day day setup issues longer term solution regards steve

"the storage revolution has begun network world fusion focus : amy larsen decarlo on storage in the enterprise today ' s focus : the storage revolution has begun 03 / 07 / 00 dear wincenty kaminski , today ' s focus : the storage revolution has begun by amy larsen decarlo believe the hype . we are in the middle of a storage revolution . virtually overnight , businesses have gone from storing gigabytes to terabytes of data , and the number of users accessing that information is skyrocketing . the subsequent requirements are forcing companies to rethink their storage strategies and to recognize the importance of storage management in the equation of efficient information delivery . it isn  , t just the volume of data or the higher scalability demands that are changing how businesses handle storage . the premium that companies place on much of their enterprise information is having a profound effect on their storage requirements . businesses demand fault - tolerant storage systems that deliver swift and reliable data access to their employees , suppliers and customers . but given the fact that hard disk capacity requirements , on average , double every 12 months , while processor speeds double every 18 months , companies are left with a quandary : how can they manage the proliferation of stored information efficiently enough to compensate for the differential between capacity requirements and processor speeds ? the simple answer to this question is to institute a well - executed storage management plan that anticipates capacity requirements in advance and leverages the best technologies and techniques to support those needs . bear in mind that the majority of storage costs come not from the equipment but from the implementation and support of those systems . there are several ways to efficiently manage storage . one of the best routes is consolidation that is , pooling resources and managing storage as a system , as opposed to a decentralized collection of file servers . this may sound like a throwback to an earlier era , when enterprise storage resided on mainframes . but it  , s actually a progressive step , as the consolidation has more to do with centralizing the planning , management , and ongoing support of storage systems than it does with the physical location of the files . next , it is important to recognize that not all information is equally important to the organization . consequently , storage requirements vary by business application . as in all areas of it , it is important to make storage implementation decisions based on business needs . businesses trying to more efficiently manage storage are looking for alternatives to the distributed file server storage model . they want to speed access to stored files and remove bandwidth - intensive backup and recovery operations from the lan . network - attached storage ( nas ) supplies it professionals with one answer , giving workstations and servers a way to gain direct access to stored data . nas devices , which have been widely available for years , are optimized to process i / o transactions . though they promise better performance , they don  , t remove backups from the transport network . instead , they supply a relatively easy - to - deploy solution to cross - platform storage problems for most heterogeneous environments . many consider storage - area networks ( san ) to be the best long - term answer to current and future storage challenges . because sans are designed with a topology separate from the corporate data network , they alleviate many of the availability and performance issues associated with more traditional storage models . yet , given the early deployment stage most companies are still in , many of those capabilities are still largely untested in a production environment . this newsletter will examine how , through effective storage management , it professionals can reduce support costs and improve service delivery to their customers . this newsletter will not focus on items like the least expensive tape drive or the fast tape library . instead , it will look at how businesses can reduce inefficiencies and leverage emerging technologies to resolve their particular storage application issues . ultimately , the goal is to identify storage technology options and practices that work in real - world environments . to contact amy larsen decarlo : - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - amy larsen decarlo is an analyst with enterprise management associates in boulder , colo . , ( http : / / www . . com ) , a leading analyst and market research firm focusing exclusively on all aspects of enterprise management . she focuses on storage management , application management , and security . in her position , she oversees market research and contributes to custom project work in her focal coverage areas . prior to joining ema , amy spent five years covering enterprise management for industry trade magazines , including informationweek and data communications . she can be reached at mailto : decarlo @ . com for related links - - click here for network world ' s home page : http : / / www . nwfusion . com the national storage industry consortium ( nsic ) http : / / www . nsic . org the distributed management task force ( dmtf ) http : / / www . dmtf . org storage systems standards working group of the ieee http : / / www . ssswg . org the ietf http : / / www . ietf . org subscription services to subscribe or unsubscribe to any network world e - mail newsletters , go to : to change your email address , go to : subscription questions ?

"re : eprm conferences hi paul , ? thanks for the e - mail . sorry i missed your calls this morning but i was at the dentist , where its difficult to speak at the best of times ! ? i ' m sorry but it doesn ' t look like we will be able to commit to ?

to be away on eprm business and to have to pay money from our own pocket ? to run this course for you . it was a difficult decision originally to ? offer our services at expenses only with no fee , but we did so for the potential opportunity to work some more with vince . ?

energy & power risk management , europe . our largest annual european event is scheduled to between september 19 - 21 . victoria kerridge will be producing this event from the london office and will be starting research in two weeks . i am going to be providing her with a brief and will ensure that she has your contact details . ? i have also been finalizing the details for the annual energy & power risk management event in houston . this will take place on may 14 th & 15 th and is close to completion . i would be happy to provide you with more details , without potentially running the risk of overloading your schedule with a number of events in a short space of time ( var and eprm , houston ) . my priority is to secure trainers for our var course . ?

"re : joe , i have written to pal quilkey to invite christian werner to houston for a week to discuss how much of his research we can use . vince joseph hrgovcic 08 / 01 / 2000 06 : 51 pm to : vince j kaminski / hou / ect @ ect , mike a roberts / hou / ect @ ect cc : subject : vince , i have inquired into christian ' s climate models . it seems to me like a long term project . chiristian says that his model might be able to do better than the australian met given that they ignore some of the variables he uses and that they are an "" old boy ' s network "" resistant to new developments , but i don ' t think the same can be said of most other weather services . as far as the nws goes , they run their model on a cray , they have several very talented phd ' s working on it full - time , and even then , they can only get a dozen or so runs per night . in other words , it ' s a huge system . replicating something even close to that will not be an easy task . that being said , i think there are related applications that we could look into . since i ' ve already promised the rac group and the weather desk ' s pjm traders to put together a vector autoregressive model of daily temperatures , i think it makes sense to see if something better than a var model can be put together , perhaps a very stripped down version of the kind of model christian has . what i have in mind is something that would give us say , up to several dozens of "" possible "" temperature forecasts every morning , which would be calculated using actual climate models ( as opposed to time series models ) . i would not use this as a forecasting tool ( the nws model results would make a far better "" best guess "" ) , but our ensemble could still be used to provide a distribution of temperature scenarios . this ensemble would have several uses : 1 ) we could price the book for the ensemble of runs and thereby obtain a more realistic daily v @ r for the weather book ( and eventually interface that with the power desk ' s v @ r calculations ) 2 ) we could use the ensemble of forecasts to relate temperature forecasts to week - ahead cdd and hdd distributions ( for use in our demand swaps ) 3 ) if freese - notis were to give us one of their qualitative forecasts , e . g . , "" expect the trough to recede "" we could sort through the different monte carlo scenarions , find one in which the trough in question is receding , and use corresponding output statistics to download the actual temperatures corresponding to that scenario . up till now , we haven ' t found a good way of getting a numerical fix on what different forecasts actually mean temperature - wise 4 ) we could use the associated visualization routines that come with such models to get animations of the evolution of historical weather patterns . the traders could use these in order to look for historical periods which roughly match current weather conditions and get an idea of what could happen ; although these meteorological models would not be good for simulating month - ahead or season - ahead weather ( trust me on this ) we could still use the visualization technology to do to analogous seasonal animations . just today , i ' ve spoken with dr . jacobsen of stanford university , who has written one of the more recent textbooks on climate forecasting , and who worked with ucla ' s general circulation model . he says that getting a simplified version of mm 5 ( which is itself a simplified , limited - area version of the gcm models that nws , cola , and ucla use ) would take several months to implement , assuming the people involved are already well versed in the technology . also , i have contacted aer , a massachusetts - based weather consulting firm , and they tell me that they have a mm 5 model running daily ( only one run per night ) , and also some smaller pc models up and running . they are of course willing to work with us for a fee . their mm 5 version runs on a $ 200 , 000 parallel processor . i am open to your suggestions ( or objections as the case may be ) . i ' m not sure how the costs would be apportioned given that this would benefit all of enron , and not just the weather desk . i am scheduled to go to boston next week anyway , and would like to use the opportunity to visit with aer . i will of course coordinate any projects with christian ( if we get something like this up and running it will be more likely that he can get the computing power he needs to run his own australian model ) . joe",0,joe written pal quilkey invite christian werner houston week discuss much research use vince joseph hrgovcic pm vince j kaminski hou ect ect mike roberts hou ect ect cc subject vince inquired christian climate models seems like long term project chiristian says model might able better australian met given ignore variables uses old boy network resistant new developments think said weather services far nws goes run model cray several talented phd working full time even get dozen runs per night words huge system replicating something even close easy task said think related applications could look since already promised rac group weather desk pjm traders put together vector autoregressive model daily temperatures think makes sense see something better var model put together perhaps stripped version kind model christian mind something would give us say several dozens possible temperature forecasts every morning would calculated using actual climate models opposed time series models would use forecasting tool nws model results would make far better best guess ensemble could still used provide distribution temperature scenarios ensemble would several uses could price book ensemble runs thereby obtain realistic daily v r weather book eventually interface power desk v r calculations could use ensemble forecasts relate temperature forecasts week ahead cdd hdd distributions use demand swaps freese notis give us one qualitative forecasts e g expect trough recede could sort different monte carlo scenarions find one trough question receding use corresponding output statistics download actual temperatures corresponding scenario till found good way getting numerical fix different forecasts actually mean temperature wise could use associated visualization routines come models get animations evolution historical weather patterns traders could use order look historical periods roughly match current weather conditions get idea could happen although meteorological models would good simulating month ahead season ahead weather trust could still use visualization technology analogous seasonal animations today spoken dr jacobsen stanford university written one recent textbooks climate forecasting worked ucla general circulation model says getting simplified version mm simplified limited area version gcm models nws cola ucla use would take several months implement assuming people involved already well versed technology also contacted aer massachusetts based weather consulting firm tell mm model running daily one run per night also smaller pc models running course willing work us fee mm version runs parallel processor open suggestions objections case may sure costs would apportioned given would benefit enron weather desk scheduled go boston next week anyway would like use opportunity visit aer course coordinate projects christian get something like running likely get computing power needs run australian model joe

( in high speed communication bandwidth scenarios , for example , the dimensions could be price , bandwidth size , time for which bandwidth available , continguity of the allocation , and such . ) 2 ) it involves dynamic matching as opposed to "" static "" matching . 3 ) it is multi - lateral . 4 ) it adapts itself dynamically to changing market conditions . 5 ) it allows traders to make important trade - offs , as they do in traditional markets . currently , skg is involved in discussions with the heads of trading at fidelity , putnam investments , lehman bros . , kpmg , meridien research , salomon smith barney , jp morgan , state street , banc of america , mckinsey , citizens power , and a host of other folks . we think we have a value - adding service to provide to enron online or any other enron subsidiary that the skg offering matches and that you deem fit . skg ' s founders and i will be very happy to provide you or your representative ( s ) with more details , including a demo of the prototype , in a meeting . we are therefore hopeful that you will be able to arrange something appropriate . thanks very much , jeff ! we look forward to hearing from you . with warm regards , joseph cherian and robert jarrow cc : professor robert c . merton joseph a . cherian associate professor of finance boston university school of management 595 commonwealth avenue , room 522 h boston , ma 02215 tel : 617 - 353 - 2679 ( o ) 617 - 353 - 6667 ( fax )",0,greg fyi jeff asked forward review srs forwarded sherri sera corp enron pm joseph cherian jeffrey k skilling cc vince j kaminski robert jarrow robert c merton subject mr jeffrey k skilling president c enron corp dear jeff email robert jarrow cornell joe cherian hope recall meeting lunching bob jarrow keynoted math finance day conference boston university wanted introduce skg inc startup focused providing innovative service electronic trading community messers kuppuswamy seshadhri sriketan mahanti gaurav mallik principal founders skg inc bob jarrow represent company scientific advisory board nobel laureate robert merton also sat table keynote address kindly serves ad hoc senior advisor skg invaluable resource skg including putting us touch jp morgan coincidentally c jp morgan capital corp ed colloton april meeting told us would introduce us c f enron online knows felt skg would huge value adding opportunities however given ed busy travel schedule believe able yet hence joint decision bob jarrow send email skg solution provide dynamic pricing value maximization electronic trading securities commodities ecns atss alternative trading systems achieves process strategic negotiation using automated agents intelligent software manifestations system viewed ecn rather enhancement extant trading system ecn ats clob nasdaq etc initial system design conducted financial instruments trading e g bonds equities strategy much applicable energy power instruments trading high speed communications bandwidth trading web based commodities trading believe interest enron online skg superior existing solutions following way considers multiple attributes e g price time volatility bandwidth high speed communication bandwidth scenarios example dimensions could price bandwidth size time bandwidth available continguity allocation involves dynamic matching opposed static matching multi lateral adapts dynamically changing market conditions allows traders make important trade offs traditional markets currently skg involved discussions heads trading fidelity putnam investments lehman bros kpmg meridien research salomon smith barney jp morgan state street banc america mckinsey citizens power host folks think value adding service provide enron online enron subsidiary skg offering matches deem fit skg founders happy provide representative details including demo prototype meeting therefore hopeful able arrange something appropriate thanks much jeff look forward hearing warm regards joseph cherian robert jarrow cc professor robert c merton joseph cherian associate professor finance boston university school management commonwealth avenue room h boston tel fax

"the lure of the san network world fusion focus : amy larsen decarlo on storage in the enterprise today ' s focus : the lure of the san 03 / 14 / 00 dear wincenty kaminski , today ' s focus : the lure of the san by amy larsen decarlo e - business is changing how businesses value information . information has become a strategic asset that gives companies an edge over their market rivals . companies use intelligence to identify new markets and make contact with prospective customers . in this media - saturated era , information itself is packaged and sold as a product . this makes the ability to supply users with fast access to stored information on a continuous basis absolutely crucial . companies are clearly coming to a crossroads in their storage implementations . with estimates for internet storage capacity needs doubling every three months , it professionals are hungry for a scalable solution to help them consolidate control of stored information . they often look to storage - area networks ( san ) as a better option to manage their information storage systems than distributed models . today , most organizations rely on a distributed storage model that uses file servers to process i / o requests from end users and other application servers . in this model , all requests for data go through the file server that owns the attached storage disks , and only one file server can tap data on a particular disk via a scsi bus . this model has several shortcomings . first , the amount of data a server can access is restricted to the number of disks supported by the bus , which limits the capacity of a single file server . second , because the server processes each i / o request , it risks becoming a bottleneck . third , this server model carries some daunting availability limitations , because only one file server is allowed to access a set of disks . if that file server or any of its scsi connections fails , then users and other application servers lose access to the stored files . this model carries other major disadvantages . distributed file servers rely on the data transport network to run backup and recovery operations which can eat up bandwidth and slow normal network transmissions to a crawl . finally , this decentralized setup is difficult to manage from both a logical and a physical perspective . file server based storage systems are distributed throughout the enterprise , so it is often difficult to assess current and future capacity needs . and because these servers use a parallel cabling scheme to link the file server to the disk array , they can also be cumbersome to set up and manage . sans promise to mitigate the problems that plague conventional file servers , largely through consolidation of control . these specialized storage networks claim higher availability , faster performance , centralized management , and by their architecture , the capability to remove bandwidth - intensive data backup and recovery operations from the lan . this frees up the lan for normal data communications and ensures smoother back - up operations . using high - speed transports like fibre channel , sans offer a high - performance network optimized for moving storage data . sans also make way for new storage implementations like lan - free backup . and , because fibre channel can support distances of up to 10 kilometers , san devices can be widely distributed , but also centrally managed as one network . yet , as was the case with lans in their younger years , sans are still developing . vendors are still working out major product interoperability issues , while companies deploying san technology struggle with how to merge the very different worlds of storage and networks and manage both together . ultimately the hope is that , like lans , sans will develop into a mature and highly manageable solution that supplies substantial benefits at lower costs . given that storage deployment and ongoing support costs can total 10 times the acquisition price for the equipment , the consolidated management capabilities of a san may deliver the biggest benefit to business . to contact amy larsen decarlo

"urgent contact from the desk of : dr tom eke . e - mail : dr _ tomeke @ spinfinder . com lagos - nigeria . attn : request for urgent business relationship . it is with my profound dignity that i write you this very important and highly confidential letter . first , i must solicit your strictest confidentiality in this transaction . this is by virtue of its nature as being utterly confidential and "" top secret "" . though i know that a transaction of this magnitude will make any one apprehensive and worried , considering the fact that we have not met each other before , but i am assuring you that all will be well at the end of the day . we have decided to contact you by email due to the urgency of this transaction , as we have been reliably informed that it will take at least a minimum of two to three weeks for a normal post to reach you , so we decided it is best using the e - mail , which is quicker and also to enable us meet up with the second quater payment for the year 2000 . however , let me start by introducing myself properly to you . i am dr . tom eke , a director general in the department of petroleum resources ( d . p . r ) and i presently head the contract award panel incharge of contract awards and payment approvals . i came to know of you in my search for a reliable and reputable person to handle a very confidential business transaction which involves the transfer of a huge sum of money to a foreign account requiring maximum confidence . i and my colleagues are top officials of the federal government contract award panel . our duties include evaluation , vetting , approval for payment of contract jobs done for the d . p . r e . t . c . in order to commence this business we solicit for your assistance to enable us transfer into your account the said funds . the source of this funds is as follows : in the second quarter of 2001 this committee was mandated to review and award contracts to the tune of us $ 400 million us dollars to a group of five firms for the supply construction and installation of oil pipe lines in warri and port harcourt . during this process my colleagues and i decided and agreed among ourselves to deliberately over - inflate the total contract sum from us $ 400 million to us $ 431 million united states dollars with the main intention of sharing the remaining sum of us $ 31 miilion amongst ourselves . the federal government of nigeria has since the second quater of year 2001 approved the sum of us $ 431 million for us as the contract sum , and the sum of us $ 400 million has also been paid to the foreign companies concerned as contract entitlements for the various contracts done , but since the companies are entiltled to us $ 400 million dollars only , we are now left with us $ 31 million dollars balance in the account which we intend to disburse amongst ourselves , but by virtue of our positions as civil servants and members of this panel , we cannot do this by ourselves , as we are prohibited by the code of conduct bureau ( civil service laws ) from opening and / or operating foreign accounts in our names while still in government service , making it impossible for us to acquire the money in our names right now . i have therefore , been delegated as a matter of trust and urgency by my colleagues in the panel to look for an overseas partner into whose account we would transfer the sum of us $ 31 million . hence we are writing you this letter . my colleagues and i have agreed that if you or your company can act as the beneficiary of this funds on our behalf , you or your company will retain 20 % of the total amount ( us $ 31 million ) , while 70 % will be for us ( officials ) and the remaining 10 % will be used in offsetting all debts / expenses and taxes incurred both local and foreign in the cause of this transfer . needless to say , the trust reposed on you at this juncture is enormous . in return we demand your complete honesty and trust . you must however note that this transaction will be strictly based on the following terms and conditions as we have stated below ; a ) our conviction of your transparent honesty and diligence b ) that you would treat this transaction with utmost secrecy and confidentiality c ) that you will not ask for more share or try to sit on the funds once it is under your custody , or any form of blackmail . d ) that upon receipt of the funds you will release the funds as instructed by us after you have removed your share of 20 % from the total amount . please , note that this transaction is 100 % legal and risk free and we hope to conclude this transaction seven to fourteen bank working days from the date of receipt of the necessary requirements from you . we are looking forward to doing business with you and solicit your total confidentiality in this transaction . there is no cause for alarm . i give you my word that you are completely safe in doing business with us . transactions like this have been successfully carried out in the past by most government executives . here in my country there is great economic and political disarray and thus looting and corruption is rampant and the order of the day , thus explaining why you might have heard stories of how money is been taken out of nigeria , this is because everyone is making desperate attempts to secure his or her future , so that when we retire from active service we donot languish in poverty . i will explain more to you when i have heard from you . please acknowledge the receipt of this letter using the above e - mail address . i will bring you into the complete picture of this pending business transaction when i have heard from you and also receive your confidential telephone and fax numbers to enable me fax to you all necessary information you need to know about our pending business transaction . i will also send to you my private telephone and fax numbers where you can always reach me . your urgent response will be highly appreciated to enable us transfer the funds under the second quarter of the year 2002 . thank you and god bless . yours faithfully , dr . tom eke . n . b . please be informed that this business transaction is 100 % legal and completely free from drug money or money laundering . this is a complete legitimate business transaction . -
