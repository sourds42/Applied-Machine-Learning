"re : preface for book julie , the introduction looks fine . i have made some cosmetic changes ( typos and split infinitives that slipped by ) . you can safely ignore most of them . english is not even my second language . the corrections are in pink . vince "" julie "" on 08 / 01 / 2000 07 : 43 : 10 am to : "" vincejkaminski "" cc : subject : preface for book vince , ? hope you are well . ? we spoke a while ago about who should write the preface for the book , and you kindly offered that you would provide this . ? is this still possible ? ? we realise that you are extremely busy , so chris and les went ahead and wrote something , which is below , and if you want to review , change or re - write ? the preface , that would be very appreciated . ? let me know what your thoughts are . ? thanks , julie ( we ' re getting close ) ? ? preface ? ? ? one of our main objectives in writing energy derivatives : pricing and risk management has been to bring together as many of the various approaches for the pricing and risk management energy derivatives as possible , to discuss in - depth the models , and to show how they relate to each other . ? in this way we hope to help the reader to analyse the different models , price a wide range of energy derivatives , or to build a risk management system which uses a consistent modelling framework . ? we believe that for practitioners this last point is very important and we continue to stress in our articles and presentations the dangers of having flawed risk management and giving arbitrage opportunities to your competitors by using ad - hoc and inconsistent models for different instruments and markets ( see also others who propose consistent models ? ) . ? however , it is not our wish to concentrate on one particular model or models , at the exclusion of the others because we believe that the choice should rest with the user ( although it will probably be clear from our discussions the model ( s ) we prefer ) . ? we therefore try and give as clear account as possible of the advantage and disadvantages of all the models so that the reader can make an informed choice as to the models which best suit their needs . ? in order to meet our objectives the book is divided into 11 chapters . ? in chapter 1 we give an overview of the fundamental principals needed to model and price energy derivatives which will underpin the remainder of the book . ? in addition to introducing the techniques that underlie the black - scholes modelling framework we outline the numerical techniques of trinomial trees and monte carlo simulation for derivative pricing , which are used throughout the book . ? in chapter 2 we discuss the analysis of spot energy prices . ? as well as analysing empirical price movements we propose a number of processes that can be used to model the prices . ? we look at the well - know process of geometric brownian motion as well as mean reversion , stochastic volatility and jump processes , discussing each and showing how they can be simulated and their parameters estimated . ? chapter 3 , written by vince kaminski , grant masson and ronnie chahal of enron corp . , discusses volatility estimation in energy commodity markets . ? this chapter builds on the previous one . ? it examines in detail the methods , merits and pitfalls of the volatility estimation process assuming different pricing models introduced in chapter 2 . ? examples from crude , gas , and electricity markets are used to illustrate the technical and interpretative aspects of calculating volatility . ? chapter 4 examines forward curves in the energy markets . ? although such curves are well understood and straight - forward in the most financial markets , the difficulty of storage in many energy markets leads to less well defined curves . ? in this chapter we describe forward price bounds for energy prices and the building of forward curves from market instruments . ? we outline the three main approaches which have been applied to building forward curves in energy markets ; the arbitrage approach , the econometric approach , and deriving analytical values by modelling underlying stochastic factors . ? chapter 5 presents an overview of structures found in the energy derivative markets and discusses their uses . ? examples of products analysed in this chapter include a variety of swaps , caps , floors and collars , as well as energy swaptions , compound options , asian options , barrier options , lookback options , and ladder options . ? chapter 6 investigates single and multi - factor models of the energy spot price and the pricing of some standard energy derivatives . ? closed form solutions for forward prices , forward volatilities , and european option prices both on the spot and forwards are derived and presented for all the models in this chapter including a three factor , stochastic convenience yield and interest rate model . ? chapter 7 shows how the prices of path dependent and american style options can be evaluated for the models in chapter 6 . ? simulation schemes are developed for the evaluation of european style options and applied to a variety of path dependent options . ? in order to price options which incorporate early exercise opportunities , a trinomial tree scheme is developed . ? this tree is built to be consistent with the observed forward curve and can be used to price exotic as well as standard european and american style options . ? chapter 8 describes a methodology for valuing energy options based on modelling the whole of the market observed forward curve . ? the approach results in a multi - factor model that is able to realistically capture the evolution of a wide range of energy forward curves . ? the user defined volatility structures can be of an extremely general form . ? closed - form solutions are developed for pricing standard european options , and efficient monte carlo schemes are presented for pricing exotic options . ? the chapter closes with a discussion of the valuation of american style options . ? chapter 9 focuses on the risk management of energy derivative positions . ? in this chapter we discuss the management of price risk for institutions that trade options or other derivatives and who are then faced with the problem of managing the risk through time . ? we begin with delta hedging a portfolio containing derivatives and look at extensions to gamma hedging  ) illustrating the techniques using both spot and forward curve models . ? the general model presented in chapter 8 is ideally suited to multi - factor hedging of a portfolio of energy derivatives and this is also discussed . ? chapter 10 examines the key risk management concept of value at risk ( var ) applied to portfolios containing energy derivative products . ? after discussing the concept of the measure , we look at how the key inputs ( volatilities , covariances , correlations , etc ) can be estimated . ? we then compare the fours major methodologies for computing var ; delta , delta - gamma , historical simulation and monte - carlo simulation , applying each to the same portfolio of energy options . ? in this chapter we also look at testing the var estimates for various underlying energy market variables . ? finally , in chapter 11 we review modelling approaches to credit risk . ? we look in detail at two quite different approaches , creditmetrics ( j . p . morgan ( 1997 ) ) and creditrisk + ( credit suisse financial products ( 1997 ) ) for which detailed information is publicly available . ? together these provide an extensive set of tools with which to measure credit risk . ? we present numerical examples of applying these techniques to energy derivatives . ? before we begin we stress that the models and methods we present in this book are tools which should be used with the benefit of an understanding of how both the  + tool  , and the market works . ? the techniques we describe are certainly not  & magic wands  8 which can be waved at data and risk management problems to provide instant and perfect solutions . ? to quote from the riskmetrics technical document  &  ( no amount of sophisticated analytics will replace experience and professional judgement in managing risk .  8 . ? however , the right tools , correctly used make the job a lot easier !",0,preface

"a better investment than the stock market . all our mailings are sent complying to the proposed h . r . 3113 unsolicited commercial electronic mail act of 2000 . please see the bottom of this message for further information and removal instructions . parents of 15 - year old - find $ 71 , 000 cash hidden in his closet ! does this headline look familiar ? of course it does . you most likely have just seen this story recently featured on a major nightly news program ( usa ) . and reported elsewhere in the world ( including my neck of the woods - new zealand ) . his mother was cleaning and putting laundry away when she came across a large brown paper bag that was suspiciously buried beneath some clothes and a skateboard in the back of her 15 - year - old sons closet . nothing could have prepared her for the shock she got when she opened the bag and found it was full of cash . five - dollar bills , twenties , fifties and hundreds - all neatly rubber - banded in labelled piles . "" my first thought was that he had robbed a bank "" , says the 41 - year - old woman , "" there was over $ 71 , 000 dollars in that bag - - that ' s more than my husband earns in a year "" . the woman immediately called her husband at the car - dealership where he worked to tell him what she had discovered . he came home right away and they drove together to the boys school and picked him up . little did they suspect that where the money came from was more shocking than actually finding it in the closet . as it turns out , the boy had been sending out , via e - mail , a type of "" report "" to e - mail addresses that he obtained off the internet . everyday after school for the past 2 months , he had been doing this right on his computer in his bedroom . "" i just got the e - mail one day and i figured what the heck , i put my name on it like the instructions said and i started sending it out "" , says the clever 15 - year - old . the e - mail letter listed 5 addresses and contained instructions to send one $ 5 dollar bill to each person on the list , then delete the address at the top and move the others addresses down , and finally to add your name to the top of the list . the letter goes on to state that you would receive several thousand dollars in five - dollar bills within 2 weeks if you sent out the letter with your name at the top of the 5 - address list . "" i get junk e - mail all the time , and really did not think it was going to work "" , the boy continues . within the first few days of sending out the e - mail , the post office box that his parents had gotten him for his video - game magazine subscriptions began to fill up with not magazines , but envelopes containing $ 5 bills . "" about a week later i rode [ my bike ] down to the post office and my box had 1 magazine and about 300 envelops stuffed in it . there was also a yellow slip that said i had to go up to the [ post office ] counter . i thought i was in trouble or something ( laughs ) "" . he goes on , "" i went up to the counter and they had a whole box of more mail for me . i had to ride back home and empty out my backpack because i could not carry it all "" . over the next few weeks , the boy continued sending out the e - mail . "" the money just kept coming in and i just kept sorting it and stashing it in the closet , barely had time for my homework "" . he had also been riding his bike to several of the banks in his area and exchanging the $ 5 bills for twenties , fifties and hundreds . "" i didn ' t want the banks to get suspicious so i kept riding to different banks with like five thousand at a time in my backpack . i would usually tell the lady at the bank counter that my dad had sent me in to exchange the money ] and he was outside waiting for me . one time the lady gave me a really strange look and told me that she would not be able to do it for me and my dad would have to come in and do it , but i just rode to the next bank down the street ( laughs ) . "" surprisingly , the boy did not have any reason to be afraid . the reporting news team examined and investigated the so - called "" chain - letter "" the boy was sending out and found that it was not a chain - letter at all . in fact , it was completely legal according to us postal and lottery laws , title 18 , section 1302 and 1341 , or title 18 , section 3005 in the us code , also in the code of federal regulations , volume 16 , sections 255 and 436 , which state a product or service must be exchanged for money received . every five - dollar bill that he received contained a little note that read , "" please send me report number xyx "" . this simple note made the letter legal because he was exchanging a service ( a report on how - to ) for a five - dollar fee .

there are over 150 million people on the internet worldwide and counting . believe me , many people will do just that , and more ! method # 2 : by placing free ads on the internet advertising on the net is very very inexpensive and there are hundreds of free places to advertise . placing a lot of free ads on the internet will easily get a larger response . we strongly suggest you start with method # 1 and add method # 2 as you go along . for every $ 5 you receive , all you must do is e - mail them the report they ordered . that ' s it . always provide same day service on all orders . this will guarantee that the e - mail they send out with your name and address on it , will be prompt because they can not advertise until they receive the report . = order each report by its number & name only . notes : always send $ 5 cash ( u . s . currency ) for each report . checks not accepted . make sure the cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least 2 sheets of paper or aluminum foil . on one of those sheets of paper , write the number & the name of the report you are ordering , your e - mail address and your name and postal address . place your order for these reports now : report # 1 : the insider ' s guide to advertising for free on the net order report # 1 from : r . r . po box 18048 chicago , il 60618 report # 2 : the insider ' s guide to sending bulk e - mail on the net order report # 2 from : gm boland 353 jonestown rd . suite 125 winston salem , nc 27104 report # 3 : secret to multilevel marketing on the net order report # 3 from : r . chernick po box 771661 c . s . florida 33077 report # 4 : how to become a millionaire utilizing mlm & the net order report # 4 from : m . eiseman po box 451971 sunrise , florida 33345 - 1971 report # 5 : how to send out one million emails for free order report # 5 from : l . samon po box 31 castletown isle of man im 99 5 xp $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ your success guidelines $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ follow these guidelines to guarantee your success : + + + if you do not receive at least 10 orders for report # 1 within 2 weeks , continue sending e - mails until you do . = orders , 2 to 3 weeks after that you should receive 100 orders or more for report # 2 . if you did not , continue advertising or sending e - mails until you do . + + + once you have received 100 or more orders for report # 2 , you can relax , because the system is already working for you , and the cash will continue to roll in ! this is important to remember : every time your name is moved down on the list , you are placed in front of a different report . you can keep track of your progress by watching which report people are ordering from you . if you want to generate more income send another batch of e - mails and start the whole process again . there is no limit to the income you can generate from this business ! ! ! following is a note from the originator of this program : you have just received information that can give you financial freedom for the rest of your life , with no risk and just a little bit of effort . you can make more money in the next few weeks and months than you have ever imagined . follow the program exactly as instructed . do not change it in any way . it works exceedingly well as it is now . remember to e - mail a copy of this exciting report after you have put your name and address in report # 1 and moved others to # 2 thru # 5 as instructed above . one of the people you send this to may send out 100 , 000 or more e - mails and your name will be on every one of them . remember though , the more you send out the more potential customers you will reach . so my friend , i have given you the ideas , information , materials and opportunity to become financially independent . it is up to you now ! + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + more testimonials + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + "" my name is mitchell . my wife , jody and i live in chicago . i am an accountant with a major u . s . corporation and i make pretty good money . when i received this program i grumbled to jody about receiving "" junk mail "" . i made fun of the whole thing , spouting my knowledge of the population and percentages involved . i "" knew "" it wouldn ' t work . jody totally ignored my supposed intelligence and few days later she jumped in with both feet . i made merciless fun of her , and was ready to lay the old "" i told you so "" on her when the thing didn ' t work . well , the laugh was on me ! within 3 weeks she had received 50 responses . within the next 45 days she had received total $ 147 , 200 . 00 . . . . all cash ! i was shocked . i have joined jody in her "" hobby "" . mitchell wolf , chicago , illinois "" not being the gambling type , it took me several weeks to make up my mind to participate in this plan . but conservative that i am , i decided that the initial investment was so little that there was just no way that i wouldn ' t get enough orders to at least get my money back "" .

mail . my phone number is ( 617 ) 492 - 9551 . i graduated from princeton university in 1996 ( mathematics ) , and came straight to mit for a ph . d . in operations management at the sloan schoolof management . in my first three years i took all the required coursework in mathematics , optimization , stochastic processes , etc . , as well as a number of courses in psychology ( at mit and harvard ) . i am working with prof . gabriel bitran , and i am interested in the mathematical modeling of service operations . in particular , i am interested in the interaction between customers and companies ( hence the interest in psychology ) . the ( tentative ) title of my phd thesis is "" pricing substitute products on the internet "" , and i am sending you the summary which i sent to tom gros a few weeks ago that will give you an idea of what this research is about . thanks again , and i ' m looking forward to meeting you and your research group next week . paulo pricing substitute products on the internet objective : to develop new tools to decide pricing policies for goods and services sold on the internet . motivation : this research is motivated by the fact that traditional choice and optimization models are not appropriate for internet - related businesses . the technological innovations associated with the internet brought about an overload of information which inevitably affects the ways in which consumers make choices . furthermore , companies have a great deal of influence on how much information consumers can have access to . the problem of pricing substitute products is an important strategic issue faced by internet companies . consumers usually search for generic products ( e . g . vcrs or computers ) without knowing exactly what they will buy . companies can show different products and different prices to each consumer . this type of flexibility was not available until the internet came about . the problem of pricing substitute products is not unique to the internet . the methodology developed by this research should be transferable to a number of other settings , such as pricing services . services are unique , and there are many cases where customers will only buy one of many services offered by a given company . our model will help companies decide which services to offer to which customers and how much to charge for these services . research strategy : our research strategy is to divide the pricing problem into two components which can be combined to generate optimal pricing strategies . these components are choice models and optimization models . choice models : choice models describe how customers make choices . the management literature draws on two main sources for these models : psychology and economics . the common approach in psychology models is to use what are called heuristic elimination methods . these methods consist of the elimination of options based on the sequential elimination of features until only one choice remains . these methods tend to be very context - specific and do not lend themselves very easily to mathematical analysis . economists focus on utility - maximing models that are significantly more mathematically tractable than psychological models . the most common economic model of choice is the logit model . the problem with these types of models is that they are not very accurate reflections of how consumer make choices on the internet . the first step in our research will be to develop choice models that capture the interactions going on between customers and companies on the internet . optimization : traditionally , the optimization problem consists of maximizing revenue over a certain planning horizon . on the internet , the problem of maximizing revenue still exists , but there is also a need to learn about customers . short term profit is based on sales , but long term profit is based on how well you know your customers and are able to retain them . the optimization problem must therefore include a short term component ( sales ) and a long term component ( learning ) .",0,summer intern paulo oliveira vince information paulo would slated work summer april hodgeson matt harris streaming media products may add value advertising related area actually would also good fit helping think ways analyze enron line data asked send resume mean time relevant information attached stinson forwarded stinson gibner hou ect paulo rocha e oliveira pm stinson gibner cc subject trip houston stinson thank e mail phone number graduated princeton university mathematics came straight mit ph operations management sloan schoolof management first three years took required coursework mathematics optimization stochastic processes etc well number courses psychology mit harvard working prof gabriel bitran interested mathematical modeling service operations particular interested interaction customers companies hence interest psychology tentative title phd thesis pricing substitute products internet sending summary sent tom gros weeks ago give idea research thanks looking forward meeting research group next week paulo pricing substitute products internet objective develop new tools decide pricing policies goods services sold internet motivation research motivated fact traditional choice optimization models appropriate internet related businesses technological innovations associated internet brought overload information inevitably affects ways consumers make choices furthermore companies great deal influence much information consumers access problem pricing substitute products important strategic issue faced internet companies consumers usually search generic products e g vcrs computers without knowing exactly buy companies show different products different prices consumer type flexibility available internet came problem pricing substitute products unique internet methodology developed research transferable number settings pricing services services unique many cases customers buy one many services offered given company model help companies decide services offer customers much charge services research strategy research strategy divide pricing problem two components combined generate optimal pricing strategies components choice models optimization models choice models choice models describe customers make choices management literature draws two main sources models psychology economics common approach psychology models use called heuristic elimination methods methods consist elimination options based sequential elimination features one choice remains methods tend context specific lend easily mathematical analysis economists focus utility maximing models significantly mathematically tractable psychological models common economic model choice logit model problem types models accurate reflections consumer make choices internet first step research develop choice models capture interactions going customers companies internet optimization traditionally optimization problem consists maximizing revenue certain planning horizon internet problem maximizing revenue still exists also need learn customers short term profit based sales long term profit based well know customers able retain optimization problem must therefore include short term component sales long term component learning

"lng by rail vince , i was thinking about the type of things you could be talking to jeff shankman about , in the dabhol lng context . it occurred to me that one way to collect on regas charges , and still find alternate cutomers for gas is through the railways . some time back , i had looked into the possiblility of transporting lng by train . apparently , technology exists wherein lng can be put into cryogenic containers that can be trucked as well as the same containers being loaded from trucks to train bogies . i believe this maybe a way to earn some monies with lng by developing just such a market in india for commercial customers . it is pertinent to note that the konkan rail line is just about 1 hr . 45 minutes from the dabhol plant . trucks from dabhol could carry lng to the rail line at guhagar from where it could travel up and down the west coast of india . if we target end - consumers directly , we could easily sell at retail type prices , and build in a large margin , even if the volumes disposed are relatively smaller . ( the alternative fuel for most of these establishments is diesel or naphtha which is highly priced , and mostly trucked along roads , increasing costs ) . the end aim is to keep income targets in india , so that the analysts do not have a field day with the stock . hence keeping activity up in india , and showing that solutions exist , will keep stock price buoyed . we could explore this idea if it appeals ! regards , sandeep .",0,lng rail vince thinking type things could talking jeff shankman dabhol lng context occurred one way collect regas charges still find alternate cutomers gas railways time back looked possiblility transporting lng train apparently technology exists wherein lng put cryogenic containers trucked well containers loaded trucks train bogies believe maybe way earn monies lng developing market india commercial customers pertinent note konkan rail line hr minutes dabhol plant trucks dabhol could carry lng rail line guhagar could travel west coast india target end consumers directly could easily sell retail type prices build large margin even volumes disposed relatively smaller alternative fuel establishments diesel naphtha highly priced mostly trucked along roads increasing costs end aim keep income targets india analysts field day stock hence keeping activity india showing solutions exist keep stock price buoyed could explore idea appeals regards sandeep

"" while bansal declined comment on the board decision , the sources said the indian side had expressed its interest to holds talks on the issue rather than terminating the project and there were possibilities of a fresh power purchase agreement between the company and the state . ( pti ) the economic times , friday apr 27 2001 mseb pays rs 134 cr under ' protest ' to dpc despite the threat of a possible termination notice hanging on its head , maharashtra state electricity board on thursday made a "" protest payment "" of rs 134 crore disputed amount , towards march bill of rs 146 . 64 crore to dabhol . "" we were ready with the payment on wednesday itself , but dpc officials could not collect the cheque due to the statewide bandh "" , a senior mseb official said . "" we have disputed payment of rs 12 . 64 crore and it would be now taken up at the disputes resolution forum , of which enron india managing director k wade cline and krishna rao are members "" , mseb sources said . last week , dpc had dashed off a communication to the government and mseb that it would not accept "" protest payments "" anymore . cline had said the energy major shall treat such payments as an election to pay the sums , which mseb in fact owed dpc in full and that the company would also not recognise the "" purported protest or reservation "" . mseb had paid a rs 113 . 5 crore february bill in protest last month . on april 23 last , both domestic and international lenders of dpc had met in london and held exhaustive discussions the multinational ' s move to issue a termination notice to mseb and state government . ( pti ) business standard , friday , april 27 , 001 enron india md authorised to terminate ppa the board of the enron - promoted dabhol power company ( dpc ) , at its meeting in london on wednesday , authorised the managing director of enron india to issue a notice for terminating the power purchase agreement to the maharashtra state electricity board and the state government .  & the board has authorised wade cline to serve the termination notice . however , this does not mean that the termination notice will be served immediately . it is only an enabling provision and will be used only if the situation arises ,  8 a state government source told business standard from london . he said dpc was under pressure from its lenders . the dpc spokesperson here refused to comment on the issue . the hardening of the board  , s stand is in sharp contrast to the advice of dpc ' s lenders , who had warned enron not to precipitate matters by issuing a termination notice . the lenders had arrived at a consensus that the termination notice need not be served at this stage . serving of the notice requires a nod from the lenders , who have an exposure of about $ 2 billion in the project . sources said given the lenders ' strong opposition to termination of the contract , the enron board ' s "" enabling resolution "" did not have much significance beyond conveying a hardening of its stand with regard to the current imbroglio . the maharashtra chief minister had warned enron not to scuttle the process of crisis resolution by issuing a termination notice . the state government is to nominate an expert group to renegotiate the terms of the dabhol contract . enron holds 65 per cent in dpc , while us - based ge and bechtel hold 10 per cent each . the balance 15 per cent is held by mseb through a special purpose vehicle , maharashtra power development corporation . the mseb representatives were not allowed to vote at the meeting since they were an interested party . the idbi representative protested against the board ' s decision . the meeting was attended by state energy secretary vm lal . the meeting was held against the backdrop of a dispute between mseb and dpc over payment of bills . after mseb failed to pay rs 102 crore towards the december 2000 bill , dpc invoked the state government ' s guarantee and then the union government ' s counter guarantee . when payment of the rs 127 - crore january bill became overdue , dpc again invoked the state government ' s guarantee . mseb retaliated on january 28 , 2001 by slapping a rs 401 - crore penalty for non - supply of electricity at adequate levels . it demanded that dpc adjust the bills against this penalty . "" this stand of mseb was explained to dpc at the board meeting "" , a state government official said . the centre also supported mseb ' s stand and refused to honour the counter guarantee . the power company then invoked the political force majeure clause . a process of conciliation and arbitration between the centre and dpc is currently on . the financial express , friday , april 27 , 2001 foreign lenders slam brakes on disbursements to dpc , sanjay jog & raghu mohan global banks comfortable with enron pull - out lenders to the dabhol power company ( dpc ) are a sharply divided lot . international lenders , in direct contrast to the stand taken by local ones led by the the industrial develoment bank of india ( idbi ) , are categorical that additional assistance to dpc  , s phase - ii will be held in abeyance despite the completion of 92 per cent of the project work . the stage is also set for a preliminary termination notice to be served by dpc to the maharashtra state electricity board ( mseb ) within the next four weeks . this follows the authorisation given to enron india  , s managing director k wade cline and dpc president & ceo neil mcgregor to serve the termination notice , and transfer notices to mseb , following wednesday  , s dpc board meeting in london . the essence of the message from the international lenders following the london meeting with dpc board is : emotions do not work . contractual obligations and payments have to be met . we are convinced that the mseb has failed to meet its obligations . there is no point in enron continuing with the project and the company should get out of it . the structuring of dpc  , s debt has created two classes of lenders . in phase - i , international lenders are covered by a sovereign guarantee while in phase - ii , no lender is . however , all lenders have a parri passu charge , making attachment of assets a messy affair . sources in international banks were quick to point out that local lenders to phase - ii of the project are worried that an awry dpc project will affect their interests more given that they have no security  * other than assets  * like a sovereign cover .  & it was this desperation that made local lenders like idbi slash the interest rates a few months back to 16 . 5 per cent from 21 . 5 per cent ,  8 a leading foreign banker pointed out . three points that were made clear and stressed in no uncertain terms by international lenders were : a ) there are contractual obligations b ) mseb was not punctual in its payments to dpc and c ) mseb adopted a confrontational position by slapping a rs 401 crore rebate charge on dpc for misdeclaration and default on the availability of power . while local lenders led by idbi  * with mseb parroting the same  * were of the view that the current situation is a temporary one , international lenders were steadfast that pulling out of the project is the only way out . this is despite the stance taken by idbi and mseb that authorisation for termination given to mr cline and mr mcgregor was not called for . international bankers pointed out that they will now have to look at the issue of charges and protection for their loans in the event of the power project being scrapped in its present form . the points of contention are : a ) that phase - i of dpc is backed by a sovereign guarantee b ) phase - ii is not and c ) to the extent that phase - ii is covered by assets , cancellation of phase - ii may see all assets  * even those under phase - i  * getting attached . therefore , an examination on the segregation of assets under phase - i and phase - ii is now warranted . pti adds : in a significant move , dpc board has empowered its management to sever power supply agreement with mseb , a move that could inflict a financial liability of about rs 2840 crore on the centre . a decision to authorise dpc president neil mcgregor to issue a termination notice to mseb for sale of power was taken by the board at its meeting on wednesday . the indian express , friday , april 27 , 2001 enron : dabhol chief gets powers to end deal with the mseb the board of dabhol power company , a subsidiary of houston - based enron corp , has decided to warn the maharashtra state electricity board ( mseb ) that it intends to pull the plug on its guhagar - based project . in a board meeting held in london on wednesday , the board decided to authorise dpc president and ceo neil mcgregor and enron india  , s managing director k wade cline to serve a  +  + preliminary  ,  , termination notice for sale of power to the mseb within the next four weeks . the dabhol project has been mired in disputes since mseb began missing payments last year . mseb owes dabhol power $ 48 million for power delivered in december and january . the payment ran into a dispute after mseb slapped penalty notices of rs 401 crore on dpc for its failure to supply power within three hours of the demand being placed . but mseb has paid $ 24 million for february . and a payment of $ 31 million was made for march on thursday . the $ 3 billion dabhol project is the largest foreign investment made in india to date . issuing the preliminary termination notice could enable dabhol to suspend deliveries as it negotiates payment disputes . while a preliminary termination notice is the first of three steps that could potentially lead to the abandonment of the project by enron , analysts have described the decision as a  +  + procedural  ,  , move consistent with dpc  , s negotiating strategy to recover overdue payments from the mseb . after the company issues the preliminary termination notice , step two would be an official termination notice , and step three would be a notice that the company is surrendering control of the project . if the project is terminated , the government of india will have to take a hit of $ 300 million besides paying bills of rs 1 , 500 crore for the next one year to enron as penalty .  +  + our ( centre  , s ) liability , if dabhol power project is terminated , would be one year  , s electricity bill and a termination fee of $ 300 million ,  ,  , power secretary a k basu said .  +  + contractually , the centre will have to pay one year  , s electricity bill , totalling at present prices about rs 1 , 400 - 1 , 500 crore , and take over dpc  , s debt , which stands at around $ 300 million , if the project was terminated ,  ,  , basu said in delhi . dabhol power is in the process of completing the second phase of the 2 , 184 - megawatt power - plant project , which is 95 per cent through . while the international lenders to the project are pressurising the company to get out of the project , indian lenders , led by idbi , are asking the company to reconsider its decision on its termination notice . during the meeting in london , mseb which holds a 15 per cent stake in the project , had strongly opposed dpc  , s move to authorise cline and mcgregor to issue notices for termination . mseb chairman vinay bansal and technical director prem paunikar  * both directors on the dpc board  * and the state principal secretary ( energy ) vm lal , an invitee to the board , raised the issue at the board meeting in london . mseb claimed that dpc was needlessly  +  + threatening  ,  , to issue various arbitration notices and thereby interpreting the clauses of ppa in isolation . in recent weeks , dabhol has raised the stakes in its spat with the mseb , delivering a notice of political force majeure to maharashtra  * a step typically invoked to dissolve a contract in case of an emergency like a war , coup , or a similar radical political event . in this case , dpc  , s move was viewed as a threat to stop providing electricity . dpc has come under fire because of the relatively high cost of its power . critics object to the company charging rs 7 . 1 a kilowatt - hour for its power , compared with around rs 1 . 5 a kilowatt - hour charged by other suppliers . the hindu , friday , april 27 , 2001 offer of renegotiation ' too late ' : enron , by mahesh vijapurkar mumbai , april 26 . the enron - sponsored dabhol power company , which last night authorised its local management to issue a notice of termination of its power purchase agreement ( ppa ) with the maharashtra state electricity board , has decided to keep a stiff upper lip . this , in turn , has stoked speculation that the switching off of power from its phase i plant was imminent , while in reality , a lengthy procedure has to be followed as prescribed within the ppa . as one source familiar with the ppa told the hindu , ` ` it is not sudden death of the project ' ' and in all probability , the dpc , vexed with the developments , including sharp and pointed observations by the godbole committee , has chosen to only arm itself with a serious option . ` ` this would only eventually come into effect . it is not an overnight operation and a lot of legal work is involved ' ' . apparently , the dpc intends to do some arm - twisting . at the board of directors meeting in london , which maharashtra was initially disinclined to attend but later used the forum to put across its contentions on the project , the dpc squarely told the mseb nominees on the board that the offer of renegotiation had come rather ` ` too late ' ' . it also said it did not see any room for optimism about the outcome . it did not , however , rule out the option of talks , thus underscoring the possibility that the decision to authorise termination was a new weapon . the maharashtra chief minister , mr . vilasrao deshmukh , had hoped that dpc would not take any ` ` harsh step ' ' which would cause lot of damage to the interests of both the independent power producer and the government and today he expressed his dismay . in fact , the mandate of the team that went , on the strength of its stake in the dpc , was to put across the idea that negotiation was the requirement and not confrontation . echo in ls the enron issue also echoed in the lok sabha today where the power minister , mr . suresh prabhu , said that scrapping of the agreement would cost the centre rs . 2 , 840 crores , whose liability in the project agreement was limited . the centre ' s liability in case of termination is one year ' s electricity bill and a termination fee of $ 300 million . blow to fis the termination could prove to be a serious blow to the indian financial institutions ( fis ) which , under the leadership of the idbi , were trying to convince the other lenders of the project against the notice . the exposure of indian fis in the project is understood to be not covered by any guarantee either of the centre or the state . the times of india , friday , 27 april 2001 enron ready to pull out , but lenders say wait the dabhol power company board , which met on wednesday in london , authorised the company management to issue a termination notice to the maharashtra state electricity board . the company , however , may not pull out of the project yet , considering its lenders , who met on monday , opposed such a move and favoured renegotiations . sources present during both the meetings said that though foreign lenders supported enron on the termination issue , domestic financial institutions , led by the industrial development bank of india , prevailed over the deliberations to oppose any such drastic move . enron needs the lenders ' consent to file a pre - termination notice for pulling out from the project . the decision to empower dpc chief wade cline to issue a termination notice was taken with six votes in favour against a single idbi vote against such a move . another significant development during the entire proceedings was that the financial institutions made it clear that further funding of phase ii of the project will depend on the government of india assuring payment mechanisms . institutions are yet to disburse about 30 per cent of the sanctioned package , which is crucial for completing the phase ii expansion project . ` ` the board has given powers to wade cline to issue a pre - termination notice . but the meeting quite unanimously felt the need of the hour is not to terminate the project but to initiate serious re - negotiation proceedings , ' ' said mseb chairman vinay bansal , who attended the board meeting . ` ` mseb presented their views to the board members and it was understood by enron which also included the rs 401 crore penalty issue which is heading for arbitration proceedings . ` ` we have also made it clear that the tariff structure of enron is quite high and a downward revision of tariffs is unavoidable , "" bansal added . ` ` they cannot issue a termination notice without our consent since our exposure in the project is quite large and the lenders should approve any plans in that direction , ' ' said a top banker who was present during the lenders ' meet . ` ` there is a general consensus that the project must be completed and the proposal to terminate the ppa should be kept in abeyance , ' ' he added . the global arrangers for the dpc include anz investment bank , credit suisse first boston , abn - amro , citibank and the state bank of india , where all these parties conducted separate meetings with the company officials . however , some bankers said the company can file a termination notice even if one lender with a minimum 5 per cent exposure on the project favours such proceedings . meanwhile , in a clear reversal of roles , maharashtra chief minister vilasrao deshmukh said that the state government was not keen on terminating the ppa . ` ` we will ask them to refrain from taking any such harsh steps since that would be bad news for all of us , including dpc , ' ' deshmukh said . deshmukh was echoing union power minister suresh prabhu ' s sentiments , who said that the government wanted an amicable settlement of the payment row . he , however , added that termination of the project would not hurt foreign investments , and dismissed warnings by analysts that winding up the $ 2 . 9 billion project would be a blow to india ' s efforts to woo foreign investors . the dpc has already slapped one conciliation notice on the centre and three arbitration notices on the state government over non - payment of dues amounting to rs 213 crore and interest towards the bills due for december 2000 and january 2001 . meanwhile , mseb officials said in mumbai that the march bills amounting to rs 134 crore was paid on thursday as protest payment , despite the dispute over the amount . when asked on the future course of action , bansal said it was up to the dpc . the hindu businessline , friday , april 27 , 2001 dpc board authorises md to issue ppa termination notice the board of directors of dabhol power company ( dpc ) has authorised the managing director , mr neil mcgregor , to issue the notice of intent to terminate its power purchase agreement ( ppa ) with the maharashtra state electricity board ( mseb ) ` ` at an appropriate time ' ' . the decision was taken at a board meeting held in london yesterday . ` ` while mseb , which is an ` interested party ' , was not allowed to vote , it made a presentation clarifying its stand on the matter , ' ' a senior state government official said . the resolution to authorise the management to issue the termination notice was carried by six votes to one . idbi voted against the decision , the official said . the serving of the preliminary termination notice will lead to a six - month ` ` suspension period ' ' . according to clause 17 . 8 of the termination procedure , of the ppa : ` ` following the giving of a preliminary termination notice , the parties shall consult for a period of six months ( or such longer period as they may agree ) as to what step shall be taken with a view to mitigating the consequences of the relevant event having regard to all the circumstances . . . ' ' idbi and state bank of india , the principal indian lenders , had earlier persuaded the overseas lenders to hold their consent to the termination notice for some more time . at least one lender has to consent for the company to serve termination notice . it is understood that overseas lenders are in favour of termination of the project and are prepared to consent . however , domestic lenders are worried about the security of their advances if the ppa is abandoned mid - way . according to institutional sources , indian lenders are trying to get all the parties concerned to thrash out outstanding issues . the maharashtra and central governments too are in favour of a conciliation . mr vilasrao deshmukh , chief minister of maharashtra , yesterday went on record that the state did not want the project terminated . mr yashwant sinha , union finance minister , is also understood to be of the same opinion . ` ` the dpc will now have to decide what is the ` appropriate time ' to serve the notice , ' ' the official said . mseb pays rs 134 crore : meanwhile , mseb has paid dpc rs 134 crore towards its march 2001 bill . mseb officials confirmed that the bill was paid ` in protest ' ' today morning . ` ` they ( dpc ) had billed us for an amount of rs 146 crore . we do not agree with some of the items included , ' ' a senior mseb official said . the pioneer , friday , april 27 , 2001 enron testing maharashtra ' s nerves , t n raghunatha dabhol power company ( dpc ) has begun to put fresh pressure on the maharashtra state electricity board ( mseb ) , the maharashtra state government and the centre for an early resolution to the prolonged dispute between them , if the dpc board of directors ' decision to authorise its managing director to serve a contract termination notice to the mseb is any indication . the dpc board , in its meeting in london on wednesday , empowered the company management to sever its power supply agreement with mseb , a move that could inflict a financial liability of rs 2 , 840 crore on the centre . the decision to authorise the dpc management to issue a termination notice to mseb was taken by a vote of six to one after the maharasthra government representatives were prevented from voting on the ground of "" interested party "" . when contacted , the company ' s mumbai - based spokesperson , mr jimmy mogal , declined to comment on the reports about the decision taken by the dpc board . "" we have nothing to say on the reports emanating from london . we will express our views after a few days , "" he said . however , maharashtra chief minister vilasrao deshmukh on thursday termed the dpc board ' s decision as "" unfortunate "" . "" we have already requested the company not to take any harsh decision "" , mr deshmukh said in mumbai . official sources in the state energy ministry interpreted the dpc board ' s decision as a pressure tactic employed by the enron subsidiary to force the mseb to clear the pending power bills without any further delay . through its tough posture , the dpc wants to make its position stronger before it can formally agree for re - negotiations with the mseb , the centre and the state government for cutting the price of power supplied by it to the state electricity board . the sources said that the dpc ' s reported decision to authorise its managing director to stop electricity supply to the mseb did not mean that the enron subsidiary would actually go ahead with the scrapping of the power contract with the mseb . "" if anything , the dpc ' s reported decision is to mount additional pressure on the mseb for clearance of pending power bills and put itself in a stronger position in settling its dispute with the mseb . as part of its plan to arm itself with powers to break a contract in case situation goes beyond its control , the dpc had recently served a political force majeure to the mseb , the centre and the state government , "" the sources said . not surprisingly , the dpc ' s london decision comes on the heels of the maharashtra government ' s decision to set up a high - level committee , comprising representatives of the mseb , the centre and the state government to re - negotiate with the enron ' s subsidiary company for reducing the cost of power supplied to the state electricity board . meanwhile , amidst the threat of a possible termination notice hanging on its head , the mseb on thursday made a "" protest payment "" of the rs 134 crore disputed amount towards march bill of rs 146 . 64 crore to dpc . riday , april 27 the telegraph , friday , april 27 , 2001 enron signal to switch off dabhol power enron today took the first decisive step out of the controversy - ridden dabhol power company when it won an authorisation from the company  , s board to stop sale of power to maharashtra state electricity board ( mseb ) . the meeting of the company , of which the houston - based energy giant holds 65 per cent and the mseb 15 per cent , was attended by state energy secretary v m lal and mseb technical director p paunikar and it came days after its lenders discussed payment problems and a possible termination . the centre  , s liability , if enron decides to snap the agreement , will be a year  , s power bill and a termination fee of $ 300 million . however , the company will have to wait for six months from the day it serves the notice before it pulls the plug . the centre shrugged off the move , saying there would not be any adverse effect on foreign investment in power if enron walks out .  & we do not see fdi inflows into the power sector being hit ,  8 power minister suresh prabhu said . mseb officials said the ball is now in the court of dpc , which said its corporate policy did not allow it to comment on proceedings at board meetings . the decision coincided with a rs 134 - crore  + protest payment  , by the cash - strapped power board as part of the march bill worth rs 146 . 64 crore . there was speculation that mseb coughed up the amount to cool frayed tempers at enron  , s hub in houston , and because it was rattled by the sudden turn of events in the past few days during which the dispute had come to a head . mseb officials brushed away the allusions , saying the cheque was ready on wednesday but could not be handed over to dpc because of the state - wide bandh .  & we have a disputed payment of rs 12 . 64 crore , which will be taken up at the dispute - resolution forum ,  8 a board official said . last week , dpc told the state government and mseb it would no longer accept protest payments in a move to fortify its legal position . mseb officials say bechtel and general electric , the other partners who hold around 20 per cent in dpc , are willing to go along with enron corp in terminating the deal but financial institutions such as idbi are not game because it puts their loans at risk . investments made by indian institutions are not covered under the centre  , s and state  , s counter - guarantees , unlike those made by international lenders . maharashtra chief minister vilasrao deshmukh called enron  , s decision unfortunate .  & we had told state government officials attending the enron board meeting to stop the company from winding up its operations in the state as it will harm both parties .  8 the statesman , friday , april 27 , 2001 enron threatens to pull out the enron crisis deepened with the board of directors of the dabhol power company deciding to authorise the managing director , mr k wade cline , to serve a notice of termination on the contract for the first phase of the $ 2 . 9 billion power project . the decision , which could lead to the cessation of dabhol  , s power supply to the state , was taken at the meeting held yesterday in london according to reports quoting the chairman of the maharashtra state electricity board , mr vinay bansal . while dpc officials refuse to comment on anything , it is learnt that mseb was itself prepared to serve a legal notice of termination just two days before the meeting . mseb was said to have been dissuaded by the nationalist congress party president , mr sharad pawar , and union power minister mr suresh prabhu , who had talks in new delhi with the maharashtra chief minister , mr vilasrao deshmukh , and an mseb delegation last monday . the state government has been served two arbitration notices while the centre is ready to go for conciliation with the dpc for failing to honour its counter - guarantee . further , the dpc has already slapped a notice of political force majeure which protects itself against undeserved claims in the event of exigencies that force it to take an extreme step . the union power minister , mr suresh prabhu , contended in delhi that since dpc contributed only 0 . 7 per cent of the total energy output of the country , its termination would not have such a phenomenal impact on the power situation . however , if terminations proceedings go through , enron corp , a 65 per cent share - holder in the dabhol power company , would stand to net a hefty amount in damages . the union power secretary has been quoted as saying that termination of the dpc would cost the centre rs 1 , 800 crore , which is the total of one years  , electricity bill and a termination fee of $ 300 million . according to an energy analyst , mr pradyumna kaul , the total liability would not cross rs 350 crore . however mr prabhu said in the lok sabha today that the that scrapping of the agreement would cost the centre rs 2 , 840 crore . it is learnt that on 20 april , mr deshmukh had given the go - ahead to the mseb to prepare a legal notice to be issued to enron during the meeting of the dpc  , s board of directors on wednesday . at the meeting , the energy minister , padamsinh patil , energy secretary , mr vinay mohan lal and mseb chairman mr vinay bansal , were also present . the notice was prepared over the past weekend and taken by the delegation when they called on mr prabhu on 24 april . however , the politicians convinced them that enron would not get tough , given its huge stake in the project , and that such a notice would not be necessary . the meeting thus ended with the decision to renegotiate the power tariff , with enron  , s consent . among those present at the london meeting were mr lal , mr bansal and mseb technical director , mr p paunikar , in their capacity as directors . however , they abstained from voting since they were deemed an interested party . the only vote to go against the decision was that of the idbi which is also represented on the board , it is learnt . the chief minister , mr vilasrao deshmukh , said the state was not in favour of terminating the project . this could mean that the latest manoeuvre to arm - twist the indian authorities could achieve its immediate target of getting the arrears accumulated over the past three months cleared . the mseb owes enron rs 146 . 64 crore for march 2001 and rs 229 crore for december 2000 and january 2001 . the centre today put up a brave face on enron  , s decision saying there would not be any adverse effect on foreign investment in power sector in the country , pti reported from new delhi .  & there will be no adverse impact as a result of any action by any domestic or foreign company . as far as we are concerned there will be no adverse impact on fdi in power sector ,  8 power minister suresh prabhu told reporters when asked about dpc  , s decision to authorise management to issue a termination notice to mseb . emphasising that there would be no fallout of such decision , prabhu said after the meeting of the cabinet committee on economic affairs  & we are expecting cooperation from many scandinavian countries as well as european nations in the power sector .  & in fact not only the power minister but also the prime minister of norway was here to inaugurate a seminar on power and he promised lot of cooperation in the sector .  8 mid day ' dpc may not wind up ' maharashtra chief secretary v ranganathan has said that though neil mcgregor , managing director of the dabhol power corporation ( dpc ) , has been given complete powers with regard to dpc ' s operations in the state , including the authority to wind up operations , it does not necessarily mean that mcgregor will issue such a termination notice . mcgregor was given the powers at a meeting of the dpc board in london on wednesday . ranganathan said that state officials , including maharashtra state electricity board ( mseb ) chairman vinay bansal and power secretary v m lal , have reported back to him about the meeting in london . with regard to the state ' s failure to pay enron , ranganathan said , "" bills are prepared as per the power purchase agreement ( ppa ) and dpc owes some money to us . our people informed enron officials about this . . in fact , there was no reason to give powers to the md to slap a termination notice . "" in the london meeting , mseb and industrial development bank of india ( idbi ) representatives insisted that the dpc must pay rs 411 crore since it could not supply power whenever needed . chief minister vilasrao deshmukh has already termed as unfortunate the decision of the board of the enron - promoted dpc to give mcgregor powers to wind up operations . deshmukh added , "" we have already requested enron not to take any harsh decision . "" deshmukh had earlier said , "" we have directed state government officials attending the dpc board meeting to desist the energy company from winding up operations in the state , as it would be harmful to both of us . "" enron officials are keeping mum on the issue . mcgregor said , "" i am not going to give any comment . "" mid day , april 27 , 2001 enron offers ' no comment ' on renegotiation , h s rao a crucial meeting of the board of directors of the dabhol power company ( dpc ) , promoted by the us energy major enron , was held here yesterday apparently to discuss fate of its $ 900 - million power project in maharashtra , but there was no official word on the indian and state governments ' decision to renegotiate the contract . an enron spokesman declined to divulge what transpired at the meeting , saying the issues discussed at the meeting were ' confidential ' . "" we have not received any direct communication . unless we get it and evaluate the details , we have no comments to make , "" the spokesman said when asked about the proposed decision on re - negotiation of the project in which the maharashtra state electricity board ( mseb ) has 15 per cent stake . asked whether the board had taken a decision on empowering dpc managing director neil mcgregor to wind up its operations in india , the spokesman said he had nothing to say on them . enron has reportedly authorised mcgregor to look at various options including selling the company ' s stake in dpc . maharashtra chief minister vilasrao deshmukh said in mumbai that the state government would pay up the undisputed dues to the company . he said the maharashtra government "" is not in favour of terminating the 2184 - mw project , but wanted an amicable solution to the imbroglio . "" mid day , friday , april 27 , 2001 , committee to renegotiate enron deal a committee to renegotiate the power purchase agreement with the dabhol power company will be appointed by this evening , chief minister vilasrao deshmukh said today . addressing media persons after his meeting with the noted social reformer anna hazare at his official residence varsha , deshmukh said the committee would be formed by this evening or by tomorrow , at the most . he termed as unfortunate the enron board decision empowering dpc chief neil mcgregor to serve a preliminary termination notice on the maharashtra state electricity board and said the state was willing to negotiate the issue with power company . "" renegotiations will be held as per the suggestions made by the godbole committee and the center will also depute its representative on the renegotiating committee . we don ' t want to take any hasty decision , "" deshmukh saidhe pointed that the only bone of contention with the dpc had been its expensive tariff and hoped that the issue would be resolved amicably . when pointed that the enron board had taken a decision to serve the notice despite state  9 s willingness to appoint a renegotiating committee , chief minister said it was unfortunate . earlier , in his meeting with hazare , deshmukh promised to make necessary amendments to the right to information law recently passed by the state so that the information was easily accessed by the common people . he also gave a patient hearing to hazare on his complaints of corruption in various state departments and promised action against guilty after a thorough inquiry within three months . afternoon , april 27 , 2001 ' enron ' s on ! ' state govt . to renegotiate dabhol power project , by hubert vaz the us power giant , enron power corporation ' s willingness to wrap up the dabhol power project and leave the shores may not actually materialise , though the dabhol power company chief , mr . wade cline , has been authorised to do so , since the lenders for the project would have a decisive say in the matter . disclosing this , chief minister vilasrao deshmukh confirmed this morning that the state government would churn out a compromise formula by which the power project at dabhol could be continued , and at the same time enron did not feel slighted . "" enron has not yet conveyed to us about this decision . we are waiting for their letter , "" he said . when asked what sort of compromise the state government plans to forge , mr . deshmukh said , "" let our officers come back . after that we will decide a future course of action . but we are definitely going in for renegotiation of the project . it is very difficult to predict the outcome of enron ' s decision but as of now the project is still on . "" when asked whether the project could be moved to another state , if wound up from maharashtra , mr . deshmukh said , that was not possible as per the terms of the agreement between the us company and the state government . however , it was difficult for the project to move out of the state itself , he indicated . he also confirmed that both parties would face considerable losses if the project was terminated . the board of directors of the dabhol power company , which met in london on wednesday , decided to put an end to all controversies surrounding the project once and for all by empowering the dpc chief to terminate the project , if he deemed it fit . however , this decision , as of now , does not necessarily indicate the death knell for the project . the enron project , which had been riddled with controversies right from its inception , had been a pretext for the political parties in the state to drag each other on the mat from time to time . the previous sena - bjp government , which had been out to terminate the project , however , chose to continue with it following renegotiations with enron ' s top visiting officials like ms . rebecca mark . and , the democratic front government inherited the controversial project when the governments changed hands a year and a half ago . meanwhile , state energy minister dr . padamsinh patil , when contacted at the osmanabad circuit house , said the state government and the central government have decided to appoint a joint committee to renegotiate the project with enron . "" it is not easy for them to walk out of the project just like that . they will have to go in for litigation and this would prove costly for both sides , "" he said . in case the project is terminated , the government can still manage the power needs of the state , though it would be a bit tough job , he added .",0,enron india newsdesk april th newsclips fyi news articles indian press

"info you requested kcc thank you for your interest ! judgment coursesoffers an extensive training course in "" how to collect moneyjudgments "" if you are like many people , you are not even sure what a money judgment is and why processing money judgments can earn you very substantial income . if you ever sue a company or a person and you win then you will have a money judgment against them . you are happy you won but you will soon find out the shocking fact : its now up to you to collect on the judgment . the court does not require the loser to pay you . the court will not even help you . you must trace the loser down , find their assets , their employment , bank accounts , real estate , stocks and bonds , etc . very few people know how to find these assets or what to do when they are found . the result is that millions of judgments are just sitting in files and being forgotten . in 79 % of the cases the winner of a judgment never sees a dime . the non - payment of judicial debt has grown to epidemic proportions . right now in the united states there is between 200 and 300 billion dollars of uncollectedmoney judgment debt . for every judgment that is paid , 5 more judgments take its place . we identified this massive market 8 years ago and have actively pursued judicial judgments since . we invented this business . we have perfected it into a well proven and solid profession in which only a select few will be trained in the techniques necessary to succeed . with our first hand experience we have built a course which teaches you how to start your business in this new unknown and exciting field of processing money judgments . by following the steps laid out in our course and with reasonable effort you can become very successful in the processing of money judgments . the income potential is substantial in this profession . we have associates who have taken our course and are now working full time making $ 96 , 000 . 00 to over $ 200 , 000 . 00 per year . part time associates are earning between $ 24 , 000 . 00 and $ 100 , 000 . 00 per year . some choose to operateout of their home and work by themselves . others build a sizable organization of 15 to 25 people in attractive business offices . today our company and our associates have over 126 million dollars in money judgments that we are currently processing . of this 126 million , 25 million is in the form of joint ventures between our firm and our associates . joint ventures are where we make our money . we only break even when our course is purchased . we make a 12 % margin on the reports we supply to our associates . our reporting capability is so extensive that government agencies , police officers , attorneys , credit agencies etc . , all come to us for reports . many of our associates already have real estate liens in force of between 5 million to over 15 million dollars . legally this means that when the properties are sold or refinanced our associate must be paid off . the norm is 10 % interest compounded annually on unpaid money judgments . annual interest on 5 million at 10 % translates to $ 500 , 000 . 00 annually in interest income , not counting the payment of the principal . our associates earn half of this amount or $ 250 , 000 . 00 per year . this is just for interest , not counting principle and not counting the compounding of the interest which can add substantial additional income . typically companies are sold for 10 times earnings . just based on simple interest an associate with 5 million in real estate liens could sell their business for approximately 2 . 5 million dollars . 92 % of all of our associates work out of their home ; 43 % are women and 36 % are part time . one of the benefits of working in this field is that you are not under any kind of time frame . if you decide to take off for a month on vacation then go . the judgments you are working on will be there when you return . the judgments are still in force , they do not disappear . the way we train you is non - confrontational . you use your computer and telephone to do most of the processing . you never confront the debtor . the debtor doesn ' t know who you are . you are not a collection agency . simply stated the steps to successful money processing are as follows : mail our recommended letter to companies and individuals with money judgments . ( we train you how to find out who to write to ) 8 % to 11 % of the firms and people you write will call you and ask for your help . they call you , you don ' t call them unless you want to . you send them an agreement ( supplied in the course ) to sign which splits every dollar you collect 50 % to you and 50 % to them . this applies no matter if the judgment is for $ 2 , 000 . 00 or $ 2 , 000 , 000 . 00 . you then go on - line to our computers to find the debtor and their assets . we offer over 120 powerful reports to assist you . they range from credit reports from all three credit bureaus , to bank account locates , employment locates , skip traces and locating stocks and bonds , etc . the prices of our reports are very low . typically 1 / 2 to 1 / 3 of what other firms charge . for example we charge $ 6 . 00 for an individuals credit report when some other companies charge $ 25 . 00 . once you find the debtor and their assets you file garnishments and liens on the assets you have located . ( standard fill in the blanks forms are included in the course ) when you receive the assets you keep 50 % and send 50 % to the original judgment holder . once the judgment is fully paid you mail a satisfaction of judgment to the court . ( included in the course ) quote ' s from several of our students : thomas in area code 516 writes us : "" i just wanted to drop you a short note thanking you for your excellent course . my first week , part time , will net me 3 , 700 . 00 dollars . your professionalism in both the manual and your support . you have the video opened doors for me in the future . there ' s no stopping me now . recently thomas states he has over $ 8 , 500 , 000 worth of judgments he is working on "" after only having this course for four months , larry s . in area code 314 stated to us : "" i am now making $ 2 , 000 . 00 per week and expect this to grow to twice this amountwithin the next year . i am having a ball . i have over $ 250 , 000 in judgments i am collecting on now "" after having our course for 7 months larry s . in 314 stated "" i am now making $ 12 , 000 . 00 per month and have approximately $ 500 , 000 . 00 in judgments i am collecting on . looks like i will have to hire someone to help out "" marshal in area code 407 states to us "" i feel bad , you only charged me $ 259 . 00 for this course and it is a goldmine . i have added 3 full time people to help me after only having your course for 5 months "" > from the above information and actual results you can see why we can state the following : with our course you can own your own successful business . a business which earns you substantial income now and one which could be sold in 3 - 5 years , paying you enough to retire on and travel the world . a business which is extremely interesting to be in . a business in which every day is new and exciting . none of your days will be hum - drum . your brain is challenged . a business , which protects you from corporate downsizing . a business which you can start part time from your home and later , if you so desire , you can work in full time . a business , which is your ticket to freedom from others telling you what to do . a business , which lets you control your own destiny . our training has made this happen for many others already . make it happen for you ! if the above sounds interesting to you then its time for you to talk to a real live human being , no cost

involvement - - please correct me or suggest otherwise . shalesh ganjoo is our lead analyst on this effort . in addition to his effort with your group , he is presently supporting jean mrha with pricing and standardization for a traded storage maret - - stinson gibner is directly supervising him in this effort . shalesh came to us through referal from david cox - - david discovered him at one of his speaking engagements . shalesh had talked to david about traded storage market development some time last october and david refered shalesh to enron research group . we hired shalesh for general analyst position and now he is pulled into all aspect of this storage effort . currently , he is our point person ( with stinson or i supervising his effort ) who is supporting jean mrha and you on the subject . kara knop has aproached shalesh with request for some support and shalesh and she are sorting out each other  , s role in this regard . as per my discussion today with david , we need to coordinate this storage effort from the perspective of modeling market assessment etc . for this i suggest shalesh and his effort so that all parties involved can benefit from collective effort within one central source . based on david ' s and my assessment of shalesh ' s capabilities , i would like to suggest that the commercial heads use shalesh for his creative thinking , understanding of the market and analytical capabilities and not just for data gathering and simple research effort . we can add other staff as we see the need and as you request them . please respond this e - mail with your comments if this sounds like aplan , so that we can support this effort efficiently and in a scalable manner . kind regards , ravi . a bit about ebs research group john bloomer

efforts to support enron energy trading and other enron business . enron research is involved in all aspects of enron buinesses ( ees , international , corporate affairs such as fas 133 and other accounting and new product ( derivatives ) development , etc . ) . within ebs research , there serveral professionals supporting kevin howard ( cfo office ) , john griebling , tom gros and jean mrha , david cox ( via boris ) , and the war room . our main area of focus is with jean mrha ( trading ) and john griebling ( optical network design and optimization , etc . ) . we play a key role with john

"california 1 / 17 / 01 summary : late night efforts by the california assembly to craft a legislative solution are falling short of market and creditor expectations . bankruptcy appears increasingly likely , but the dynamics of a ch . 11 proceeding remain unclear . socal edison is likely to be the first in ch . 11 following its suspended payments to creditors yesterday and is now in a 30 day cure period . attempts to bring in the assets of the parent companies are unlikely to succeed . bankruptcy would provide davis with some political cover to implement the tough decisions that he has so far avoided on the questions of rate hikes and other costs to taxpayers connected to the proposed operations of the california power authority . 1 . legislation passes assembly , but generators and consumers remain unhappy the first legislation ( ab lx ) passed the california general assembly last night , but both generators and consumers are unhappy with the terms . generators object to the 5 . 5 cent per kw / h price in the proposed long - term contract , while consumer groups such as the foundation for taxpayer and consumer rights object to the state acting as a purchaser of power . the legislation is expected to pass the senate today and to be signed by governor davis as early as tonight . press and source reporting this morning confirms that the principal financial creditors and utility analysts are also unimpressed with the bill , which is viewed as insubstantial and falling short of creating a solution to the financial pressures on the utilities . 2 . financial institutions exposure to california utilities bank of america : $ 215 million j . p . morgan : $ 202 million there is a total of $ 12 billion in outstanding loans , but much of this ( arranged by societe general ) is to the parents national energy group and edison international . the $ 417 million mentioned above is the most immediate concern . the southern california edison loans are subject to immediate repayment in the aftermath of yesterday ' s rating downgrade to junk status . the fed will not be involved , except in a routine way as a bank regulator making sure that the appropriate risk reserves are made against the utilities ' loans and securities . there is no moral hazard here , because the fed is not going to guarantee any of the utilities ' credits , which , by the way , they do not have the authority to do . 3 . pg & e / national energy group - shielding assets despite considerable anger at pg & e for reorganizing to shield its profitable assets from its debt - plagued utility business , it would seem that davis has little authority to intervene . the question of "" fraudulent conveyance "" , which is a term in bankruptcy law for transferring assets to favored parties not long before a filing ( which transfer can then be reversed by the court ) would not seem to apply here , since pg dynegy has threaten to take take edison into bankruptcy court if they default pg & e current available : $ 500 m in cash and reserves due feb : lst - $ 580 m to iso 15 th - $ 431 m to california power exchange contrary to press reports and leaks from the governor ' s office yesterday about political brinksmanship , edison is clearly not playing negotiating games and is really short of cash . in this situation , it is unlikely that its executives will be making fraudulent statements . the bonds on which they failed to pay would have a 30 - day cure period . after that the trustees will move on edison , if edison has not already filed . they have three ways of financing power purchases going forward : 1 ) the state continues to buy power and sell edison ( and pg or 2 ) pending the passage of today ' s legislation , the state legislature authorizes the purchase of power through long - term contracts under the proposed borrowing authority ; or 3 ) edison files for reorganization under chapter 11 and obtains almost immediately superpriority post - petition lines of credit secured against its unmortgaged assets , which it uses to pay for power until the puc and the rest of the state government recognize that rates have to increase . 6 . new hampshire experience a guide for davis ? following the bankruptcy of the public service company of new hampshire , the bankruptcy judge was authorized by a higher court to mandate rate hikes . the prospect of imposed rate hikes from the bankruptcy court caused the state government to subsequently determine that rate hikes to consumers were unavoidable , passing a seven year rate hike of 7 . 5 percent . for davis , a similar scenario would provide him with some political cover , if he were forced by the bankruptcy court to pass through rate hikes as part of a settlement .",0,california summary late night efforts california assembly craft legislative solution falling short market creditor expectations bankruptcy appears increasingly likely dynamics ch proceeding remain unclear socal edison likely first ch following suspended payments creditors yesterday day cure period attempts bring assets parent companies unlikely succeed bankruptcy would provide davis political cover implement tough decisions far avoided questions rate hikes costs taxpayers connected proposed operations california power authority legislation passes assembly generators consumers remain unhappy first legislation ab lx passed california general assembly last night generators consumers unhappy terms generators object cent per kw h price proposed long term contract consumer groups foundation taxpayer consumer rights object state acting purchaser power legislation expected pass senate today signed governor davis early tonight press source reporting morning confirms principal financial creditors utility analysts also unimpressed bill viewed insubstantial falling short creating solution financial pressures utilities financial institutions exposure california utilities bank america million j p morgan million total billion outstanding loans much arranged societe general parents national energy group edison international million mentioned immediate concern southern california edison loans subject immediate repayment aftermath yesterday rating downgrade junk status fed involved except routine way bank regulator making sure appropriate risk reserves made utilities loans securities moral hazard fed going guarantee utilities credits way authority pg e national energy group shielding assets despite considerable anger pg e reorganizing shield profitable assets debt plagued utility business would seem davis little authority intervene question fraudulent conveyance term bankruptcy law transferring assets favored parties long filing transfer reversed court would seem apply since pg dynegy threaten take take edison bankruptcy court default pg e current available cash reserves due feb lst iso th california power exchange contrary press reports leaks governor office yesterday political brinksmanship edison clearly playing negotiating games really short cash situation unlikely executives making fraudulent statements bonds failed pay would day cure period trustees move edison edison already filed three ways financing power purchases going forward state continues buy power sell edison pg pending passage today legislation state legislature authorizes purchase power long term contracts proposed borrowing authority edison files reorganization chapter obtains almost immediately superpriority post petition lines credit secured unmortgaged assets uses pay power puc rest state government recognize rates increase new hampshire experience guide davis following bankruptcy public service company new hampshire bankruptcy judge authorized higher court mandate rate hikes prospect imposed rate hikes bankruptcy court caused state government subsequently determine rate hikes consumers unavoidable passing seven year rate hike percent davis similar scenario would provide political cover forced bankruptcy court pass rate hikes part settlement

"75 % reduction in road accidents august , 2002 dear sir / madam , in case you have received this mail earlier , kindly ignore this mail . it may have been re - sent to you by mistake . ours is not a mailing list and we have no intention of sending any regular mails to anybody . we have devised a set of systems , which can reduce the damage caused to vehicles and deaths and injury caused to passengers and pedestrians in vehicular accidents by more than seventy - five percent we have already filed and are in process of filing further , multiple and appropriate disclosure documents , provisional patent applications at the united states patent & trademarks office ( uspto ) , and also applications under the patent co - operation treaty at world intellectual property organization ( wipo ) at geneva . there is absolutely no doubt that our idea is new and innovative . moreover , we are very confident and very sure that this will help reducing / minimizing human suffering to a very large extent . there is no doubt that the product devised by us will change the face of the earth forever . brief details relating to our product are detailed in the annexures under the following headings : statistics advantages options economics we are looking for the followings : 01 . business consultancy and advice regarding the most viable , practical and profitable course of action under the circumstances and also consultancy on patents one person moderately injured every three seconds ; one person mildly injured every three seconds . ) ( c ) current yearly automobile sales worldwide - more than 1000 billion us $ . ( d ) number of automobiles worldwide - more than 1000 billion pieces ( e ) daily loss caused due to vehicular accidents worldwide more than 2 billion us $ per day . ( 2 % of the worldwide gross national product of more than 36500 billion us $ = more than 730 us $ per year = more than 2 billion us $ per day ) theadvantages of the technology developed by us : a . the introduction of such technology will dramatically reduce the expenses of auto - insurance . this reduction of insurance cost will be at par with or even more that the expenses incurred towards the introduction of such technology in modern day vehicles . accordingly , the life insurance premier will also undergo drastic reduction . additionally , because of saving of lives , the outgo of the insurance companies will reduce substantially . b . as per the who studies and projections , road accidents occupy the number nine positions by way of causes of death in the world today . it is projected by who that by the year 2020 they will occupy the number three positions , next only to heart disease and depression . by introduction of this technology , we are sure that this will not happen . on the contrary there will be massive reduction in the number of deaths due to road accidents and road accidents may not figure on the list of major causes of death , in the year 2020 at all . c . this technology will therefore , make all vehicles cheaper and safer . not only will the cost be reduced , safety which is priceless in itself , will also be greatly enhanced . as and when the regular patent application is filed and patent is granted , the life of the patent will be 20 years . even at the current levels , with road accidents placed at number nine on the who list as a major cause of death , there is a daily loss of two billion us $ . even at the present level , over a period of twenty years , without any interest and without any compounding , this loss works out to be : 2 billion us $ x 365 days x 20 years - 14 , 600 billion us $ . d . our technology will ensure that at least seventy - five percent of the above losses are prevented . such figure works out to be more that 10 , 000 billion us $ . it is important to note that this is the projection at the current level . as per the future projections , the incidents of road accidents are expected to increase . hence , the figure is likely to be increase very substantially . in addition the time factor and the interest factor will inflate this figure further . e . at the current levels , more than 1 . 2 million persons are dying every year due to road accidents . even at the current rates , more than 24 million lives will be lost in road accidents over the next twenty years ( i . e . life of the patent , when granted ) . besides , at the current levels . 3 . 2 million people are injured every year . in the next twenty years , the number of people injured due to road accident , will therefore be more than half a billion . f . if we add to that the personal , physical and psychological traumas to those directly involved in and also to those who are associated with the people involved in the road accidents . the trauma and the misery and henceforth the value of the savings , are all unmeasurable in quantities , presently known to human kind . g . considering the figures and dynamics as explained hereinabove , it may not be improper or out of place to compare this technology with the introduction of electricity , computer or aircrafts in terms of its value to mankind . h . the benefits of this technology will be so obvious and essential that , in the very near future , the use of this technology will become unavoidable . it should and will become mandatory by law , to install such technology and the installation of such technology should and will be a pre - requisite for granting or renewal of the registration and license of all vehicles in future . i . as described hereinabove ; this technology and its utility are incomparable , outthought of , and unheard of till date . it will open a new floodgate in human travel and safety measures . in future , it can and will be applied to other mode of transport , like aircrafts and trains also . . among other things , we have the following options available to us : - options available to us : - a - outright sale ( a ) immediate outright sale of the idea and the concept along with our filed applications for one time lump sum consideration . ( b ) further development of the concept and further filing of patent and all patent related applications , before taking steps as outlined in "" a "" . the process ( b ) will obviously increase the realization in terms of price . b - licencing options i ) new vehicles - granting of licenses to manufacturers of automobiles , individually or collectively , all over the world for incorporation in the automobiles to be manufactured in future on fixed time or per piece basis . ii ) conversion of existing vehicles - to independent agents for conversion of the existing more than 1000 billion vehicles all over the world . c - combined options a collaborative arrangement with some private and / or government agency wherein we receive a certain down payment and then jointly distribute the licensing rights on a pre - decided sharing ( partnership ) arrangement . the economics of the project will be as follows : - 1 ) in case any / all processes and systems described by us are incorporated in the design of new vehicles and the new vehicles are manufactured in accordance with the modified designs , the cost escalation may not be more than 5 % to 8 % , and the safety and the protection will be ten times ( more than ) the price escalation . hence , drop in insurance premier will compensate for the cost escalation . 2 ) in case , the existing vehicles are modified , the cost involved will be approximately 10 % to 15 % of the value of the vehicle . but partial modifications at a lower cost , which will give partial protection , may also be carried out . as a thumb rule , the cost of modification in percentage terms will be about one fifth of the percentage of safety and protection provided . 3 ) in case the value of the vehicles is low or the life of the vehicle is about to expire , the partial modifications may be practically and economically viable , as incorporation onto a new vehicle is relatively less expensive and more protective . 4 ) there are more than 1000 billion motor vehicles in the world at present . besides there are an unspecified number of non - motorized ehicles . 5 ) almost all of them can be converted in phased manner to a variable degree . the cost of conversion will be directly proportional to their current market value and the safety shield to be generated there from . 6 ) among the motorised vehicles , the conversion cost may work out of few dollars for every percent of safety shield created the exact calculation can be worked out , but over all , some of the methods may provide more safety at lower cost compared to the other which may differ in efficiency . 7 ) even if we consider a very vague and approximate cost of conversion of 300 us $ per vehicle , the conversion industry works out to be worth 3 , 00 , 000 billion us $ . 8 ) realising the potential of the product in terms of human safety , it will be reasonable to presume that majority of such conversion will be completed over a period of three years from the starting date . 9 ) as pointed hereinabove , the size of the conversion industry may be estimated to , in the range of 1 , 00 , 000 billion us $ per year over the next three years . 10 ) alternatively , considering the diversity of available motorised vehicles all over the world , conversion licensing can also be commercially viable proposition . for such conversion , licenses can be granted on - line , on receipt of on - line payments . in that case , different rates for granting conversion to vehicles having specific registration numbers can be granted in accordance with and in proportion to the size , carrying capacity and the engine power of the vehicle . 11 ) in case , licensing is done , the creation and installation of the concerned systems will be done by the end - user , as per his circumstances and needs . however , piracy is likely to be a major problem in such licensing . 12 ) it is likely that as and when the systems are introduced in the motorised vehicles , unusual and unprecedented demand of new vehicles is created . this will result in massive rejection of the vehicles currently playing all over the world and stimulate an entirely new market as far as motorised vehicle is concerned . the size of such market is difficult to either comprehend and / or estimate . p . s . 1 ) some of the figures have been rounded off but generally the figures are correct . 2 ) we have tried to keep this communication brief and to the point . more details , including website references are available with us and can be provided , if required .",1,reduction road accidents august dear sir madam case received mail earlier kindly ignore mail may sent mistake mailing list intention sending regular mails anybody devised set systems

"re : equity investment fair value in turkey john , it seems to me that using a risk - free rate is not appropriate . i shall elaborate on my position and send you a longer message this afternoon ( my time ) . vince enron capital & trade resources corp . - europe from : john bottomley 06 / 19 / 2000 05 : 55 am to : vince j kaminski / hou / ect @ ect cc : john sherriff / lon / ect @ ect , dale surbey / lon / ect @ ect subject : equity investment fair value in turkey vince , john sherriff recommended that i contact you regarding an interesting ( and potentially contentious ) option valuation issue we are currently dealing with in london . we hold longish term options in a private company in turkey which is currently seeking to ipo . the issue we are discussing with rac is which discount rate ( i . e . , risk - free ? and if so turkish or us ? ) should we use to value these options first , some additional information . option characteristics : - - 116 , 000 options ( representing 9 % of the company ) - - term : minimum of 3 years but possibly longer - - still being renegotiated - - strike price : 20 % below the upcoming ipo price ( either priced in us $ or turkish lire ) we currently hold the above number of options with a fixed price of $ 118 . 75 per option but 34 , 800 expire on july 15 , 2000 with the remainder expiring on december 15 , 2000 . the company ' s investment bankers ( abn / amro rothchilds ) are concerned regarding the strike price because it values the company at $ 118 million and they believe the company is worth approx $ 300 million . due to such a large "" valuation gap "" , they originally encouraged us to exercise all of the options by the end of june ( ipo target date in late sept / early oct ) . our counter - proposal is to "" swap "" instrinsic value for time value by repricing the options strike higher while extending their term . we are currently negotiating with rac the most appropriate discount rate to use to value the options . we are arguing that the us risk free is the most appropriate discount rate and their current position is that the company ' s historical senior debt cost ( 18 % ) is the more appropriate number to use ( although admit that this is not justifiable - - only a proxy ) a few key points : - - rac is valuing the options via crystal ball simulations such that this "" to be negotiated "" discount rate is used to calculate the pv of the future options intrinsic value in 3 years ( i . e . , for black - scholes , a higher discount rate yields a higher value but the opposite is true using crystal ball simulation ) - - the model simulates both an ipo / no ipo case and in the case of no ipo we have put options for our equity priced at a fixed 17 % return - - the model assigns a 30 % illiquidity discount - - in the simulated cases where the options are out - of - the - money , we obviously do not exercise . we understand that for black - scholes option valuation , one needs to be able to construct a comparable portfolio of cash flows using equity futures and the risk free in order for the valuation to hold . and here is where we reach our difficulty : since the company doesn ' t currently trade on a public market and since equity futures do not exist for turkish equities , rac is arguing that a us risk free is not appropriate to use . our argument is that the non - ipo scenario , a 30 % illiquidity discount and a us $ based option volatility are already in the factored into the simulation . as such , we feel rac ' s approach is double counting . if you managed to get through the above , your a patient man !

"otc gdvi - the momentum continues - gdvi website debute otc bbalert gdvi news update : global diversified industries debutes brand new website ! www . gdvi . net otc bb alert spectacular operating results momentum continues sales projections for next 12 months surpasses $ 20 million 99 . 8 % revenue increase 278 % net income increase 154 % stockholders equity increase 79 % increase in assets $ 8 million order backlog $ 50 million manufacturing capacity overview global diversified industries operates in the modular building construction industry , and strategically targets the california education sector . gdvi is strategically located in central california on 16 acres with a 100 , 000 square foot state - of - the - art manufacturing facility . throughout 2003 and 2004 the company focused on building its infrastructure through acquisitions , development of a state - of - the - art manufacturing facility , and by securing the requisite financing facilities to fuel business growth . through the combination of its new facility ( $ 50 million capacity ) , the increased demand for portable buildings and the state of california ' s bond approvals , gdvi has become well positioned to become one of the dominant leaders in modular manufacturing on the west coast . gdvi should benefit greatly from the $ 12 . 1 billion school improvement bond that is expected to be passed by california voters next month ( march ) . this presents , in our opinion an opportunity for early investors of gdvi to also benefit before the mainstream investor realizes who the benefactors are and subsequently invests in those companies . global diversified has taken numerous strategic development steps throughout 2003 and 2004 , including generating strong revenues as well as profits and is now poised for explosive growth in 2005 . the company is led by a strong management team with previous success in building companies into $ 50 million per annum businesses . in the past year gdvi has exceeded its own sales revenue projections , renewed its piggyback contract , received state approvals on engineered product designs , started a new credit facility and opened its new 100 , 000 square foot manufacturing facility . the company will continue to seek new acquisition candidates through its aggressive growth plan . profile gdvi is a holding company that currently operates two wholly owned subsidiaries , mbs construction inc . , a modular contractor specializing in modular construction site work and renovation and global modular , inc . , a sales , marketing and manufacturing of modular type structures . its principal customer base is currently educational ( public and private schools , universities , etc . ) , child - care and municipality sectors . its product lines consist of a variety of portable classroom designs , including both single - story and two - story floor plans . global modular ' s portable classroom structures are engineered and constructed in accordance with pre - approved building plans , commonly referred to as p . c . ' s or pre - checked plans , that conform to structural and seismic safety specifications administered by the california department of state architects ( dsa ) . global modular also enjoys the benefit of providing educational customers with products contracted under a piggyback clause . the state of california allows school districts to canvass proposals from modular classroom vendors under a bidding process where the successful bidder can provide other public school districts and municipalities portable classrooms under a piggyback contract issued by the originating school district . this process saves school districts valuable time and resources from the necessity of soliciting bids . a modular vendor who possesses a piggyback contract containing competitive pricing and a variety of design options may have access to future business for up to five years , depending on the term of the piggyback contract . the strategic focus on california schools since 1998 , california legislation has required that at least 20 % of all new classrooms constructed with state funds be portable structures . there are five compelling reasons for this trend : modular classrooms are faster to construct ( as quickly as 2 weeks ) they cost significantly less ( as low as $ 30 , 000 vs . $ 100 , 000 ) they offer greater flexibility for use compared to conventional buildings they are easier to finance they provide financing incentives to cope with population growth , the state department of education estimates that california will need more than 2 , 500 classrooms each year for the next four years , which equates to more than 10 , 000 classrooms . due to the current and projected budget cuts throughout the california education sector , public and private schools are expected to turn to portable / modular construction to fulfill their additional classroom requirements over the next four years . the california schools budget crisis on november 5 , 2002 a $ 13 . 2 billion school facilities improvements bond proposal ( proposition 47 ) was passed by california voters . this bond measure passage does not include an approximate $ 9 . 4 billion worth of local bond measures passed by various school districts throughout the state . a second bond measure worth $ 12 . 1 billion went before the voters on the march 2004 . these bond measures are about three times higher than the record $ 9 . 2 billion bond california voters approved in 1998 . the revenue generated from these bond measures will be used for school modernization programs , which include requirements for relocatable classrooms and modular classroom construction and renovations . money from the bonds will help overcrowded public and private schools ; design upgrades and expand building space at community colleges and other institutions of higher learning throughout california . gdvi business infrastructure among global modular ' s asset base is its integrated , state - of - the - art , automated manufacturing process which includes equipment , raw material and marketing collateral that are specifically designed for the high capacity fabrication of modular structures . gdvi employs a workforce of 60 employees and is looking to add to its workforce as demand increases . operates out of a sixteen acre site with a 100 , 000 square foot operating structure . wholly owned subsidiary (

"immediate reply needed dear sir , i am dr james alabi , the chairman of contract award and review committee set up by the federal government of nigeria under the new civilian dispensation to award new contracts and review existing ones . i came to know of you in my search for a reliable and reputable person to handle a very confidential transaction , which involves the transfer of a huge sum of money to a foreign account . there were series of contracts executed by a consortium of multi - nationals in the oil industry in favor of n . n . p . c . the original values of these contracts were deliberately over invoiced to the sum of us $ 12 , 320 , 000 . 00 ( twelve million three hundred and twenty thousand united state dollars ) . this amount has now been approved and is now ready to be transferred being that the companies that actually executed these contracts have been fully paid and the projects officially commissioned . consequently , my colleagues and i are willing to transfer the total amount to your account for subsequent disbursement , since we as civil servants are prohibited by the code of conduct bureau ( civil service law ) from operating and / or opening foreign accounts in our names . needless to say , the trust reposed on you at this juncture is enormous , in return , we have agreed to offer you 20 % of the transferred sum , while 10 % shall be set aside for incidental expenses ( internal and external ) between both parties in the course of the transaction you will be mandated to remit the balance to other accounts in due course . modalities have been worked out at the highest level of the ministry of finance and the central bank of nigeria for the immediate transfer of the funds within 7 working days subject to your satisfaction of the above stated terms . our assurance is that your role is risk free . to accord this transaction the legality it deserves and for mutual security of the funds the whole approval procedures will officially and legally processed with your name or the name of any company you may nominate as the bonefide beneficiary . once more i want you to understand that having put in over twenty - five years in the civil service of my country , i am averse to having my image and career dented . this matter should therefore be treated with utmost secrecy and urgency it deserves . please you should signify your intention to assist by sending me a reply to this email to state your position on this transaction , if favorable we will take further steps to brief you the full details of this viable transaction . i want to assure you that this business proposal is 100 % risk free as we have done our homework properly . i quite believe that you will protect our interest by taking this deal strictly confidential , as we are still in government service , which we intend to retire from in full honor . kindly expedite action as we are behind schedule to enable us include this transfer in the next batch which would constitute the new quarter payments for the 2002 financial year . thank you and god bless . dr james alabi",1,immediate reply needed dear sir dr james alabi chairman contract award review committee set federal government nigeria new civilian dispensation award new contracts review existing ones came know search reliable reputable person handle confidential transaction involves transfer huge sum money foreign account series contracts executed consortium multi nationals oil industry favor n n p c original values contracts deliberately invoiced sum us twelve million three hundred twenty thousand united state dollars amount approved ready transferred companies actually executed contracts fully paid projects officially commissioned consequently colleagues willing transfer total amount account subsequent disbursement since civil servants prohibited code conduct bureau civil service law operating opening foreign accounts names needless say trust reposed juncture enormous return agreed offer transferred sum shall set aside incidental expenses internal external parties course transaction mandated remit balance accounts due course modalities worked highest level ministry finance central bank nigeria immediate transfer funds within working days subject satisfaction stated terms assurance role risk free accord transaction legality deserves mutual security funds whole approval procedures officially legally processed name name company may nominate bonefide beneficiary want understand put twenty five years civil service country averse image career dented matter therefore treated utmost secrecy urgency deserves please signify intention assist sending reply email state position transaction favorable take steps brief full details viable transaction want assure business proposal risk free done homework properly quite believe protect interest taking deal strictly confidential still government service intend retire full honor kindly expedite action behind schedule enable us include transfer next batch would constitute new quarter payments financial year thank god bless dr james alabi

"full circle : asps the new big blue ? network world fusion focus : mike jude and nancy meachim on application service providers today ' s focus : full circle : asps the new big blue ? 03 / 15 / 00 dear wincenty kaminski , today ' s focus : full circle : asps the new big blue ? by mike jude and nancy meachim the terms  & asp  8 and  & ibm  8 may have more in common than being three - letter acronyms . remember big blue of the early  + 60 s ? the vision , then , was centralized computing . mainframe computers hosted complex , expensive applications that end users accessed via dumb terminals . it infrastructure , especially memory , was expensive and needed to be controlled . with computing resources centralized , ibm reasoned , they were easier to maintain . of course , ibm got it wrong , in that computers became a cheap commodity . and users weren  , t happy simply using dumb terminals . they wanted a bigger share in all that technology offered . so , as memory prices fell , so did the idea of central control . dumb terminals were transformed into intelligent desktop machines that could store applications and data . the glass house populated by white - smocked technicians went out of fashion . looking back on those times , many of us would shake our heads and wonder how ibm could have been so wrong . but maybe big blue wasn  , t so far off . thanks to the advent of application service providers , centralized computing is making a comeback . asps offer centralized application management . the market started as a way to offer the benefits of server advertisement protocol and other complex enterprise resource planning software to small companies or companies with less technical savvy . but asps now host all kinds of applications , including small , multilicensed programs whose images are downloaded to end users on demand . but , the principle remains the same : central control makes support much more efficient and usually cheaper . how about that , ibm ? to be fair , the dynamics of an asp are very different from old centralized mainframe operations . an asp doesn  , t just host and support an application for general distribution over an in - house proprietary network . unlike the ibm vision , an asp is very dependent on network service . it is also very sensitive to service levels . in the  + 60 s , if the mainframe let you down , you ended up twiddling your thumbs for an hour or so , and your only recourse was that white - smocked fellow . nowadays , users start to scream if service is interrupted for even a minute . and woe to the asp who brings down a customer operation . the world of the asp is much more complex than that of the old  + 60 s shop . however , if one could magically transport a computer user from the  + 60 s to the wonderful new 2000 s , would it seem all that different to him ? in an ideal asp world , a la scott mcnealy  , s vision , users would sit down at a semidumb terminal , download the application du jour , and start working . what did the  + 60 s user do ? kind of the same thing ! so you are probably wondering , what is the point ? just this : ibm  , s problem was leaving the customer out of the equation . and look what happened . customers rebelled . they didn  , t buy ibm  , s spiel . it became the  & in  8 thing to hate ibm . why ? because the guys in white smocks couldn  , t spell service and didn  , t care about customers . to be successful , asps need to learn from the past . they need to tattoo service on the forehead of each of their employees . there are too many choices , today , for customers to put up with inferior service . that  , s one big difference from the  + 60 s . customers now can literally choose any service provider in the world . just being big doesn  , t cut it these days . to contact mike jude and nancy meachim : - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - senior consultant michael jude and research director nancy meachim are with enterprise management associates in boulder , colo . , ( http : / / www . . com ) , a leading analyst and market research firm focusing exclusively on all aspects of enterprise management . jude has over 18 years of experience in the telecommunications industry , most recently with us west , where he was a manager of public policy . mike can be reached at mailto : jude @ . com . meachim focuses on e - business management . she is currently conducting a research study on asp management that is due to be released in april . nancy ' s email address is mailto : meachim @ . com . for related links - - click here for network world ' s home page : http : / / www . nwfusion . com buzz : application otsourcing , network world fusion , 09 / 27 / 99 asp research page , network world all about asps information center for application service providers , their customers and delivery partners . includes resources , events and news . the asp industry consortium . http : / / www . aspindustry . org / subscription services to subscribe or unsubscribe to any network world e - mail newsletters , go to : to change your email address , go to : subscription questions ?
