"a & a math majors vince , thank you so much for meeting with me friday morning about the research group . after leaving your office , i remembered an issue i have had with the analyst & associate program that might be of interest to you . during a texas a & m recruiting meeting , i learned that we have expanded our list of majors to include computer science . i wondered why math majors were not mentioned , and was told that there was not a business need for math majors . like liberal arts majors , they said math majors were only considered on a person by person basis . in my opinion , math majors have many of the same skills as finance majors , and can easily adjust to accounting rotations as well ( i did last summer , and finance majors in the program are forced to every year . ) i think that enron is missing out on many qualified candidates by limiting their recruitment effort . at texas a & m the career center asks companies for a list of majors they are targeting , and only allows those majors to sign up for interviews through the career center . i sent my resume to enron and asked to be included in the interview process on campus . however , many other math majors had not heard of enron or the other companies , and assumed that there was no place for a math major at a company like enron . many math majors want to continue their education , become teachers , or work for an actuarial firm . however , many are undecided . we are constantly told of the many business possibilities available to math majors by our teachers and staff , but many undergraduates are still not sure exactly what math majors can contribute in a business environment . by not mentioning math majors to the career center ( a very simple and inexpensive step ) , enron is losing out on a very talented pool of people . while it would be nice to get the math majors that knew about enron already , had thoroughly researched all companies and determined that math majors would fit perfectly , and went the extra step to send enron their resume outside the career center system , there are many qualified students who do not do this , and opt for other companies who did mention math majors . i called a manager in the a & a program to suggest that we consider at least mentioning math majors to the career centers . i realize that it may cost more to actively pursue them , talk to teachers , and attend math society events . however , i told her that including them at the career center would be very inexpensive for enron . she reiterated that they saw no business need for math majors , and that if more upper level people began requesting them , it would be considered . i searched for "" mathematics "" on the enron job website , and had a surprising number of results . i know that your group could use math majors as well . however , this still may be too small a number to merit a focus from the a & a recruiting department . i just wanted to bring it to your attention in case it was something that you felt should be changed . thanks , heather johnson x 53240",0,math majors vince thank much meeting friday morning research group leaving office remembered issue analyst associate

"" there may be two separate questions to ask here . first , in the context of the current market ( or the market which may develop in the next 1 - 2 years ) , will the metarouter be a commercially viable product ? that is , will it address an actual need in the market , or would it be more cost effective just to use technicians with jumper cables to provision circuits ? the second question ( our first real technical question ) : is the metarouter technology scalable ? before starting on this project , vince and i will need to make the proper introductions with the principles who are implementing this technology . 3 . aggregation of loads . a recurring question comes from a number of areas such as ip , network storage , and streaming media transport sales : what value can i get form aggregating customers , each of which has some type of stochastic load profile ? giuseppe touched on this problem as it relates to ip transport , but it may be interesting to try and look in more detail . the main stumbling block may be that we currently have basically no actual customer data . i am told that in a few months we will have some more useful history . my understanding is that what will be available will be 5 - minute averages of usage , so we still will not know on a short time scale what the distribution of load looks like . i hope that this gives you enough information to get some idea of what our concerns are at this point . please let me know your thoughts about these topics . i would expect , for instance that question number 1 may not be reasonable as a research project , but might be a question which you would feel comfortable in addressing by giving us your qualitative opinions , maybe in the form of a talk here at enron . again , let me know your thoughts , and i look forward to seeing you again soon . stinson nick bambos on 12 / 20 / 2000 12 : 14 : 40 pm to : vince . j . kaminski @ enron . com cc : stinson . gibner @ enron . com subject : stanford project hello vince and stinson , first of all , best wishes for happy holidays ! ! ! ! if you are in the stanford area during the holidays , let ' s get together some time to have dinner . i have formally established the project - thanks again for funding it - and i have also recruited the second phd student . his name is eric cope , and he is a top - notch student , very mature , and entrepreneurial ! we have started working on some interesting problems in this area . i would hope that eric could spend the coming summer at enron to get immersed into the "" problem / opportunity generation environment .

"california update 5 / 4 / 01 if you have any questions , please contact kristin walsh at ( 713 ) 853 - 9510 . bridge loan financing bills may not meet their may 8 th deadline due to lack of support sources report there will not be a vote regarding the authorization for the bond issuance / bridge loan by the may 8 th deadline . any possibility for a deal has reportedly fallen apart . according to sources , both the republicans and democratic caucuses are turning against davis . the democratic caucus is reportedly "" unwilling to fight "" for davis . many legislative republicans and democrats reportedly do not trust davis and express concern that , once the bonds are issued to replenish the general fund , davis would "" double dip "" into the fund . clearly there is a lack of good faith between the legislature and the governor . however , it is believed once davis discloses the details of the power contracts negotiated , a bond issuance will take place . additionally , some generator sources have reported that some of the long - term power contracts ( as opposed to those still in development ) require that the bond issuance happen by july 1 , 2001 . if not , the state may be in breach of contract . sources state that if the legislature does not pass the bridge loan legislation by may 8 th , having a bond issuance by july lst will be very difficult . the republicans were planning to offer an alternative plan whereby the state would "" eat "" the $ 5 billion cost of power spent to date out of the general fund , thereby decreasing the amount of the bond issuance to approximately $ 8 billion . however , the reportedly now are not going to offer even this concession . sources report that the republicans intend to hold out for full disclosure of the governor ' s plan for handling the crisis , including the details and terms of all long - term contracts he has negotiated , before they will support the bond issuance to go forward . currently there are two bills dealing with the bridge loan ; ab 8 x and ab 31 x . ab 8 x authorizes the dwr to sell up to $ 10 billion in bonds . this bill passed the senate in march , but has stalled in the assembly due to a lack of republican support . ab 31 x deals with energy conservation programs for community college districts . however , sources report this bill may be amended to include language relevant to the bond sale by senator bowen , currently in ab 8 x . senator bowen ' s language states that the state should get paid before the utilities from rate payments ( which , if passed , would be likely to cause a socal bankruptcy ) . according to sources close to the republicans in the legislature , republicans do not believe there should be a bridge loan due to money available in the general fund . for instance , tony strickland has stated that only 1 / 2 of the bonds ( or approximately $ 5 billion ) should be issued . other republicans reportedly do not support issuing any bonds . the republicans intend to bring this up in debate on monday . additionally , lehman brothers reportedly also feels that a bridge loan is unnecessary and there are some indications that lehman may back out of the bridge loan . key points of the bridge financing initial loan amount : $ 4 . 125 b lenders : jp morgan $ 2 . 5 b lehman brothers $ 1 . 0 b bear stearns $ 625 m tax exempt portion : of the $ 4 . 125 b ; $ 1 . 6 b is expected to be tax -

9510 bill sb 6 x passed the senate yesterday , but little can be done at this time the senate passed sb 6 x yesterday , which authorizes $ 5 billion to create the california consumer power and conservation authority . the $ 5 billion authorized under sb 6 x is not the same as the $ 5 billion that must be authorized by the legislature to pay for power already purchased , or the additional amount of bonds that must be authorized to pay for purchasing power going forward . again , the republicans are not in support of these authorizations . without the details of the long - term power contracts the governor has negotiated , the republicans do not know what the final bond amount is that must be issued and that taxpayers will have to pay to support . no further action can be taken regarding the implementation of sb 6 x until it is clarified how and when the state and the utilities get paid for purchasing power . also , there is no staff , defined purpose , etc . for the california public power and conservation authority . however , this can be considered a victory for consumer advocates , who began promoting this idea earlier in the crisis . socal edison and bankruptcy at this point , two events would be likely to trigger a socal bankruptcy . the first would be a legislative rejection of the mou between socal and the governor . the specified deadline for legislative approval of the mou is august 15 th , however , some decision will likely be made earlier . according to sources , the state has yet to sign the mou with socal , though socal has signed it . the republicans are against the mou in its current form and davis and the senate lack the votes needed to pass . if the legislature indicates that it will not pas the mou , socal would likely file for voluntary bankruptcy ( or its creditor - involuntary ) due to the lack operating cash . the second likely triggering event , which is linked directly to the bond issuance , would be an effort by senator bowen to amend sb 31 x ( bridge loan ) stating that the dwr would received 100 % of its payments from ratepayers , then the utilities would receive the residual amount . in other words , the state will get paid before the utilities . if this language is included and passed by the legislature , it appears likely that socal will likely file for bankruptcy . socal is urging the legislature to pay both the utilities and the dwr proportionately from rate payments .",0,california update questions please contact kristin walsh bridge loan financing bills may meet may th deadline due lack support sources report vote regarding authorization bond issuance bridge loan may th deadline possibility deal reportedly fallen apart according sources republicans democratic caucuses turning davis democratic caucus reportedly unwilling fight davis many legislative republicans democrats reportedly trust davis express concern bonds issued replenish general fund davis would double dip fund clearly lack good faith legislature governor however believed davis discloses details power contracts negotiated bond issuance take place additionally generator sources reported long term power contracts opposed still development require bond issuance happen july state may breach contract sources state legislature pass bridge loan legislation may th bond issuance july lst difficult republicans planning offer alternative plan whereby state would eat billion cost power spent date general fund thereby decreasing amount bond issuance approximately billion however reportedly going offer even concession sources report republicans intend hold full disclosure governor plan handling crisis including details terms long term contracts negotiated support bond issuance go forward currently two bills dealing bridge loan ab x ab x ab x authorizes dwr sell billion bonds bill passed senate march stalled assembly due lack republican support ab x deals energy conservation programs community college districts however sources report bill may amended include language relevant bond sale senator bowen currently ab x senator bowen language states state get paid utilities rate payments passed would likely cause socal bankruptcy according sources close republicans legislature republicans believe bridge loan due money available general fund instance tony strickland stated bonds approximately billion issued republicans reportedly support issuing bonds republicans intend bring debate monday additionally lehman brothers reportedly also feels bridge loan unnecessary indications lehman may back bridge loan key points bridge financing initial loan amount b lenders jp morgan b lehman brothers b bear stearns tax exempt portion b b expected tax exempt projected interest rate taxable rate tax exempt rate current projected blended ir maturity date august details please contact bill sb x passed senate yesterday little done time senate passed sb x yesterday authorizes billion create california consumer power conservation authority billion authorized sb x billion must authorized legislature pay power already purchased additional amount bonds must authorized pay purchasing power going forward republicans support authorizations without details long term power contracts governor negotiated republicans know final bond amount must issued taxpayers pay support action taken regarding implementation sb x clarified state utilities get paid purchasing power also staff defined purpose etc california public power conservation authority however considered victory consumer advocates began promoting idea earlier crisis socal edison bankruptcy point two events would likely trigger socal bankruptcy first would legislative rejection mou socal governor specified deadline legislative approval mou august th however decision likely made earlier according sources state yet sign mou socal though socal signed republicans mou current form davis senate lack votes needed pass legislature indicates pas mou socal would likely file voluntary bankruptcy creditor involuntary due lack operating cash second likely triggering event linked directly bond issuance would effort senator bowen amend sb x bridge loan stating dwr would received payments ratepayers utilities would receive residual amount words state get paid utilities language included passed legislature appears likely socal likely file bankruptcy socal urging legislature pay utilities dwr proportionately rate payments

"commercialization of nasa technology hey , i thought you might like to take a look at viaspace the cohen report viaspace was founded in 1998 as a spin - off of the caltech / nasa jet propulsion laboratory ( jpl ) to transform technologies originally developed for space and defense markets into profitable commercial enterprises . viaspace seeks opportunities in high growth markets delivering on problems with growing global relevance by leveraging unique expertise not available elsewhere in the commercial world . viaspace sees a compelling business opportunity in the homeland security public safety and fuel cell markets . viaspace target markets are in excess of $ 100 b / yr and growing with a cagr of over 20 % . in the past six years viaspace has created three companies , spectrasensors , qwip technologies and vialogy corp . their websites provide a background on the commercialization of nasa technology , ( spectrasensors . com , qwip . com , vialogy . com ) . the company ' s current focus is on three subsidiaries , direct methanol fuel cell , arroyo sciences and ionfinity . direct liquid methanol fuel cell direct methanol fuel cell corporation ( dmfcc ) will provide disposable methanol fuel cell cartridges for tomorrow ' s fuel cell - powered portable electronic devices such as laptop computers and cell phones . methanol fuel cells ( dfmc ) are expected to replace lithium ion batteries in portable electronic devices . a dfmc can power a laptop for up to 10 hours on a disposable cartridge that costs $ 2 to $ 3 . a smaller cartridge can power a cell phone for up to 3 weeks . we believe consumers will spend a few extra dollars for the convenience of keeping their cell phones and other electronic devices operating . as a disposable product , it generates recurring revenue for dmfcc . the technology is protected by over 70 issued and pending patents . toshiba , nec , sanyo , and samsung have unveiled prototype fuel cell powered products that more than double the operating time over existing battery technology . dmfcc has opened a tokyo office to work closely with japanese manufacturers . arroyo sciences , inc . arroyo focuses on the fusion of radio frequency , nuclear and electromagnetic imaging to deliver information products in transportation , supply chain , security , logistics assurance and first responder safety markets . the micro tracker product enables a wireless tracking for first responders in hazardous environments . this product combines radio frequency identification ( rfid ) tags , wireless digital communications , ground positioning satellite ( gps ) , data for 2 - d and 3 - d geolocation determination , geographic information system ( gis ) and sensor technologies . real - time processing of many high data content inputs is required for the instantaneous assessment of danger . applications include improved safety for fire department personnel in emergency situations , improved coordination of multi - agency deployments and extended operations in hazardous environments . the cobra product uses the imaging and sensing technology to provide early threat indicators for coastal surveillance and public infrastructure protection such as ports , power plants , airports , and telecommunication facilities . real time sensory and image data is processed and software is customized to discriminate between friend and foe . deepscan is a software system that provides automatic analysis of air and seaport cargo containers based on x - ray and gamma ray imaging . arroyo is currently using deepscan for bomb and hazardous material detection in cargo . ionfinity ionfinity has developed the next generation mass spectrometry ( ms ) technology that is 10 times more sensitive than existing ms , with a 10 times increase in mass range . higher sensitivity enables the comprehensive monitoring and detection of biological , chemical and nuclear contaminants . the current market for ms is estimated at $ 1 . 2 billion annually . the compact size and rugged portability will expand the market . new applications include enabling port inspection personnel to detect traces of contraband , epa air quality monitoring and assisting in hazardous material clean up . additional projects under review projects not included in our forecast are ( 1 ) a water purification technology and ( 2 ) interactive radio . the water purification system displays impressive statistics in that it can convert brackish , sewage or industrial wastewater into ultra - pure water . the water system is scalable from house to municipal usage and will last 25 years while requiring minimal maintenance . the interactive radio enables a listener to receive emails or web sites delivered in response to what is broadcast . the radio station essentially receives input from listeners that could enhance advertising and improve vertical market focus . forecasts and valuation we expect revenues for dmfcc will be driven by ( 1 ) increasing wireless usage of computing devices and ( 2 ) the existing need to extend cell phone battery life . we expect revenues for dmfcc will commence in 2007 and grow to $ 195 million by 2009 . homeland security expenditures on airport and seaport security will be a primary revenue driver for arroyo sciences , which will begin to generate revenues in 2005 , and will grow to $ 90 million in 2009 . we expect commercial revenues for ionfinity will commence in late 2007 , and will be $ 10 million in 2009 . beyond 2009 , total revenues will grow at a 60 % to 80 % rate for several years from existing and new products . contracting with existing manufacturers , we expect operating margins will be in the low 40 % range by 2009 . our initial forecasts indicate a fair value range from $ 8 . 40 to $ 11 . 10 based on the projected growth for the 2009 to 2012 timeframe . the graph below outlines our valuation analysis . directors and management dr . carl kukkonen , is the ceo and founding partner . dr kukkonen was director for space microelectronics and manager of supercomputing at caltech / jpl , where he worked for 14 years . prior to jpl , dr . kukkonen was the leading expert on hydrogen as alternative fuel at ford motor company . aj abdallat , coo , and vp of business development has been with viaspace since inception , after working in business development at hewlett - packard and control data corporation . dr . sandeep gulati has been with viaspace since 2000 . during the prior 12 years , dr gulati was head of the ultracomputing technologies at nasas jpl . dr . gulati is the developer of the revolutionary signal processing technology , qri . viaspace overview viaspace was formed in july 1998 with an objective of transforming technologies from caltech / nasa ' s jet propulsion laboratory and other advanced technology centers into profitable commercial enterprises through its strong connections with the advanced technology community . through its three subsidiaries - - arroyo sciences , ionfinity , and direct methanol fuel cell corporation ( dmfcc ) - - viaspace has a diversified high tech portfolio that includes microelectronics , sensors , homeland security public safety , energy / - fuel cells , information computational technology , rfid , e - finance , and mobile e - commerce . viaspace develops proven space and defense technologies into hardware and software products that fulfill high - growth market needs and solve today ' s complex problems . viaspace benefits from important licenses and strategic relationships with caltech / nasa ' s jet propulsion laboratory and other universities research laboratories . the viaspace team has a proven expertise for the successful commercialization of innovations in information technology , physical science and life sciences developed at academic research institutions and national laboratories . the company currently focuses on technologies originally developed for nasa and the us department of defense that have already reached a certain stage of maturity . initial investments in these technologies amount to millions of dollars and many years of rd , enabling viaspace to manage the commercialization process with only a modest additional investment and greatly reduced technical risk . viaspace couples exceptional technology sourcing and validation capability with a demand - driven process of market validation . decisions about technology transfer and product development are based , first and foremost , on market needs . in addition to our internal expertise , viaspace benefits from the domain expertise of leading experts that serve on our scientific and business advisory boards and from an informal global network of researchers , technology analysts , and technology professionals and investors that would be hard to replicate . in the last six years , viaspace and its subsidiaries have secured more than $ 30 million in venture financing and strategic investment . initial investors include hewlett packard , divine interventures , los angeles county community development commission , blueprint ventures , the united company , bioprojects international , forrest binkley brown , american river ventures , and nth power . viaspace has spawned 3 companies : spectrasensors ( www . spectrasensors . com ) , qwip technologies ( www . qwip . com ) , and vialogy corp ( www . vialogy . com ) . these companies , currently at various stages of maturity , are positioned within high growth markets and poised for profitability . today , viaspace focuses its effort on its three subsidiaries -

"california update 4 / 27 / 01 the following report contains confidential and sensitive information . please treat with discretion . executive summary : ? ferc price cap decision reflects bush political and economic objectives . politically , bush is determined to let the crisis blame fall on davis ; from an economic perspective , he is unwilling to create disincentives for new power generation ? davis finds four major flaws with ferc plan , most notably its exclusion of out - of - state generators ? june lst "" kill clause "" for ferc order could coincide with new bush regional plan ? california facing growing fiscal risk following bond downgrade , expected $ 20 billion power bill this summer - - economic crisis would force deeper administration involvement ? qf bid for advance payments from pg & e likely to fail in bankruptcy court ? new generation delays probable because of state / qf squabbling ? consumer groups are preparing a constitutional challenge to socal bailout deal 1 . ferc fallout the ferc decision is a holding move by the bush administration that looks like action , but is not . rather , it allows the situation in california to continue to develop virtually unabated . the political strategy appears to allow the situation to deteriorate to the point where davis cannot escape shouldering the blame . once they are politically inoculated , the administration can begin to look at regional solutions . moreover , the administration has already made explicit ( and will certainly restate in the forthcoming cheney commission report ) its opposition to stronger price caps on the grounds that they are unwilling to create disincentives to the construction of new generation . it is interesting and ironic to note that electricity generators were generally happy with the ferc order and that the only ferc commissioner who favors price caps actually voted against this plan . 2 . something less than effective price caps from davis ' s point of view , the ferc plan has four major flaws : ? the order applies only to california , not to the rest of the west . non - california generators are not required to sell at capped rates to california . ? as the order is written , it is more of a price floor for emergency power than a ceiling . ? state officials also believe that energy suppliers will continue to game the system , because the price mitigation scheme only kicks in after a stage 2 emergency and does not require any collusion . ? even when the price caps kick in , they are based on the cost - plus for the highest cost producer supplying power to california and do not require wholesalers to abide by the cap . the generators can also charge above the cap , provided they can subsequently justify the excess charge to ferc . 3 . proposal "" kill clause "" adds to the political dilemma for davis the ferc proposal includes a "" kill clause "" that says the caps will be withdrawn unless california ' s iso agrees by june lst to become part of the regional grid now under ferc control . if davis doesn ' t sign on to the regional grid by june lst , then he will have to live with june 2 nd headlines blaming him for letting the "" bush price caps plan "" collapse . 4 . growing fiscal risk in california sources speculate that california could therefore pay as much as $ 20 billion on power this summer - this is more than the combined enterprise value of pg & e and sce . these sources believe that , because of the severity of the situation , the ferc and / or the federal government will be forced to take further action to control prices for power . the consensus is that the state of california will run out of money in about 90 days . one of the first projects to be cancelled will be state plans to finance new power plant construction in exchange for long - term power deals . the bleak fiscal picture is also causing bank creditors to revisit the bridge loans they are providing to california . the bush administration and the fed are only now waking up to the seriousness of the fiscal picture . the country ' s largest and most prosperous state will have gone from large surpluses to serious debt downgrades and devastating deficits in a matter of months . 5 . qfs to seek advance payment from pg & e meanwhile , on the bankruptcy front , the qfs reportedly will ask the bankruptcy judge today to give them advance payment from pge ' s accounts , since their natural gas vendors have likewise demanded advance payment for gas . it appears very unlikely that the qfs ' request will be granted . if the qfs do not receive advance payment , it is likely that most of the 4 , 000 mw of gas - fired qf capacity will remain offline . 6 delays likely in new qf generation the qf deals made with the state for long - term contracts are being continually renegotiated , which is likely to mean that the new plants those contracts are supposed to finance will not be online as early as anticipated . 7 . consumer groups ready to challenge constitutionality of sce bailout plan harvey rosenfield and his colleagues reportedly have been reviewing an analysis of the mou for the sce bailout plan . the analysis was done by a utilities analyst , rather than a lawyer , though it appears to raise a number of good legal points . for example , one of the elements of the mou is a "" non - bypassable "" charge on ratepayers that would require them to pay even if they disconnect from the grid . this is effectively a tax , since there is no exchange of value for money , which under the ca constitution cannot be used to directly benefit a private entity . this makes the bonds that would be issued are general obligation bonds , rather than revenue bonds . according to the constitution , the state cannot be put into debt to benefit a private company . for this and other reasons , even if the republicans would vote for the sce bailout , which remains unlikely , the bailout probably would not stand a likely constitutional challenge . 8 . governor hurt by continued failure to disclose long - term power contracts the issue of the governor ' s failure to disclose the details of the long - term power contracts continues to distress the other players in the crisis . even if he were to disclose everything he and his staff have been negotiating , it is likely that their actions and negotiations will challenged , creating an even further delay .",0,california update following report contains confidential sensitive information please treat discretion executive summary ferc price cap decision reflects bush political economic objectives politically bush determined let crisis blame fall davis economic perspective unwilling create disincentives new power generation davis finds four major flaws ferc plan notably exclusion state generators june lst kill clause ferc order could coincide new bush regional plan california facing growing fiscal risk following bond downgrade expected billion power bill summer economic crisis would force deeper administration involvement qf bid advance payments pg e likely fail bankruptcy court new generation delays probable state qf squabbling consumer groups preparing constitutional challenge socal bailout deal ferc fallout ferc decision holding move bush administration looks like action rather allows situation california continue develop virtually unabated political strategy appears allow situation deteriorate point davis escape shouldering blame politically inoculated administration begin look regional solutions moreover administration already made explicit certainly restate forthcoming cheney commission report opposition stronger price caps grounds unwilling create disincentives construction new generation interesting ironic note electricity generators generally happy ferc order ferc commissioner favors price caps actually voted plan something less effective price caps davis point view ferc plan four major flaws order applies california rest west non california generators required sell capped rates california order written price floor emergency power ceiling state officials also believe energy suppliers continue game system price mitigation scheme kicks stage emergency require collusion even price caps kick based cost plus highest cost producer supplying power california require wholesalers abide cap generators also charge cap provided subsequently justify excess charge ferc proposal kill clause adds political dilemma davis ferc proposal includes kill clause says caps withdrawn unless california iso agrees june lst become part regional grid ferc control davis sign regional grid june lst live june nd headlines blaming letting bush price caps plan collapse growing fiscal risk california sources speculate california could therefore pay much billion power summer combined enterprise value pg e sce sources believe severity situation ferc federal government forced take action control prices power consensus state california run money days one first projects cancelled state plans finance new power plant construction exchange long term power deals bleak fiscal picture also causing bank creditors revisit bridge loans providing california bush administration fed waking seriousness fiscal picture country largest prosperous state gone large surpluses serious debt downgrades devastating deficits matter months qfs seek advance payment pg e meanwhile bankruptcy front qfs reportedly ask bankruptcy judge today give advance payment pge accounts since natural gas vendors likewise demanded advance payment gas appears unlikely qfs request granted qfs receive advance payment likely mw gas fired qf capacity remain offline delays likely new qf generation qf deals made state long term contracts continually renegotiated likely mean new plants contracts supposed finance online early anticipated consumer groups ready challenge constitutionality sce bailout plan harvey rosenfield colleagues reportedly reviewing analysis mou sce bailout plan analysis done utilities analyst rather lawyer though appears raise number good legal points example one elements mou non bypassable charge ratepayers would require pay even disconnect grid effectively tax since exchange value money ca constitution used directly benefit private entity makes bonds would issued general obligation bonds rather revenue bonds according constitution state put debt benefit private company reasons even republicans would vote sce bailout remains unlikely bailout probably would stand likely constitutional challenge governor hurt continued failure disclose long term power contracts issue governor failure disclose details long term power contracts continues distress players crisis even disclose everything staff negotiating likely actions negotiations challenged creating even delay

"a colossal and dangerous failure - cera alert title : a colossal and dangerous failure url : http : / / www 20 . cera . com / eprofile ? u = 35 & m = 2185 overview : western energy  * california governor stays the course california governor gray davis provided his strongest public statements to date regarding the state  , s power crisis in his annual state of the state address on january 8 , 2001 . echoing many of his previous positions on what he perceives as a flawed and unfair california market structure , the governor labeled the state  , s electricity market system a colossal and dangerous failure . among other actions , he launched new initiatives valued at $ 1 billion to encourage conservation , provide financing and land to new generators , grant authority to utilities to engage in a portfolio of transactions to manage electricity costs , and increase regulatory scrutiny of existing market suppliers . the governor also called for a greater role for the state in overseeing and constructing new power plants . the governor acknowledged that the actions proposed are only some of the steps necessary to put california on the road to recovery . details regarding sources of funding for the initiative are still forthcoming . although he stated that california  , s investor - owned utilities must not be allowed to go bankrupt , no formal plan for ensuring their solvency was given . the financial community continues to lack the assurance it requires to continue to provide financial backing for pacific gas and electric and southern california edison . at this time the state legislature remains the body most likely to guarantee their solvency . the governor again criticized the federal energy regulatory commission for what he believes has been its failure to manage and restrain properly the wholesale market . merchant plant generators were accused of gouging the state , and it was suggested that these generators acted illegally in their operations , jeopardizing the reliability of the power grid . new , more severe sanctions were promised for those caught withholding power or extracting what investigators find as unreasonable profits . a los angeles times poll released the morning before the governor  , s address indicated that the majority of californians still do not believe there is an energy crisis . although the 33 percent growth in the state  , s economy over the past ten years has nearly outstripped the state  , s and surrounding region  , s supplies of power , the bulk of the governor  , s statements continue to focus on the culpability of power producers , rather than the serious supply shortfall . though the governor introduced steps to fund and facilitate the construction of new generating plants , increased regulatory scrutiny and the threat of sanctions will exacerbate the concern already expressed by plant developers and the financial community that the investment climate in california is excessively risky . * * end * * follow above url for complete report . come shoot the rapids with us at ceraweek 2001 , "" shooting the rapids : strategies and risks for the energy future "" in houston , february 12 - 16 , 2001 ! for more information and to register , please visit http : / / www 20 . cera . com / ceraweek / e - mail category : alert cera knowledge area ( s ) : western energy , to make changes to your cera . com account go to : forgot your username and password ? go to : http : / / www 20 . cera . com / client / forgot this electronic message and attachments , if any , contain information from cambridge energy research associates , inc .

"re : wall street micro news report homeland security investments the terror attacks on the united states on september 11 , 2001 have changed the security landscape for the foreseeable future . both physical and logical security have become paramount for all industry segments , especially in the banking , national resource and government sectors . according to giga , a wholly owned subsidiary of forrester research , worldwide demand for information security products and services is set to eclipse $ 46 b by 2005 . homeland security investments is a newsletter dedicated to providing our readers with information pertaining to investment opportunities in this lucrative sector . as we know , events related to homeland security happen with lightning speed . what we as investors can do is position ourselves in such a way as to take advantage of the current trends and be ready to capitalize on events which have yet to happen . homeland security investments is here to help our readers do just that . with this in mind , it is with great excitement that we present vinoble , inc . this stock is expected to do big things in both the near and long terms . symbol : ( vnbl ) current price : 0 . 08 short term target price : 0 . 35 12 month target price : 1 . 20 * * * why we believe vnbl . ob will give big returns on investment * * * * at this time much of vnbl ' s focus is on rfid ( radio frequency identification ) technology . this is technology which uses tiny sensors to transmit information about a person or object wirelessly . * vnbl is already an industry pioneer in the rfid personal location technology . * vnbl is developing a form of rfid technology which allows companies and governments to wirelessly track their assets and resources . such technology has huge potential in the protection and transportation of materials designated "" high risk "" were they to fall into the wrong hands . * vnbl works on integration of the two afore mentioned systems in order to create "" high security space "" in locales where it is deemed necessary . locations which may take advantage of such systems are airports , sea ports , mines , nuclear facilities , and more . * as with all stocks , news drives the short term price . fresh news has made vnbl a hot buy . news on vnbl malibu , calif . - - ( business wire ) - - june 16 , 2005 - - vinoble , inc . ( otcbb : vnbl - news ) , a holding company seeking to identify long - term growth opportunities in the areas of homeland security , security information systems , and other security services , announced today that it plans to offer products and services that will assist in the automation of the identification and control of equipment , assets , tools , and the related processes used in the oil & gas and petrochemical industries . although small wirelessly networked rfid sensors can monitor machines and equipment to detect possible problems before they become serious , they can also deliver safety features within oil wells . oil maybe trapped in different layers of rock , along with gas and water . detection of specific liquids can assist equipment in operating within a specific precise opportune moment to ensure certain adverse conditions do not occur , such as a well filling with water . as with other rf based technology applications , rfid can also provide the safe transit of materials by only the authorized handler , and limit the entry of personnel to specific locations . ensuring personnel safety is essential , should there be an emergency at a facility , rfid tags would enable the customer to track and evaluate its employee ' s safety and / or danger . this application technology requires product and hardware that can operate in harsh and potentially hazardous conditions , but gives valuable safety to the resources and assets that are vital to the customer . rfid can also assist the customer ' s supply chain by tracking oil , gas , and chemical products from extraction to refining to the sale at the retail level . vinoble ' s viewpoint as previously stated is that these applications are more than just a valuable tool to the mining industry , but as a protective measure of our country ' s natural resources and commodities against threat . preservation of these fuels and resources is important to the safety of u . s . industry and economy . the company believes that such offering service and technology application in the oil & gas and petrochemical industry will further position vinoble in a rapidly expanding industry while taking advantage of access to the increasing capital and global spending that the company will require for growth . the company ' s goal is to also provide a much - needed service at a cost manageable to even the smallest of businesses that can ' t afford to do without the safety of its personnel and assets in this current state of constant threat . this is outstanding news . the growth potential for this company is exceptional . in an already hot industry , vnbl . ob stands out as a truly innovative pioneer . we see big things happening to this stock . information within this email contains "" forward looking statements "" within the meaning of section 27 a of the securities act of 1933 and section 21 b of the securities exchange act of 1934 . any statements that express or involve discussions with respect to predictions , expectations , beliefs , plans , projections , objectives , goals , assumptions or future events or performance are not statements of historical fact and may be "" forward looking statements .

( gtts ) has translated its games into chinese and is about to hit asia . this initiative looks like a wise business decision : many analysis anticipate that china will be the biggest source of online gambling revenue by 2007 , so the company could be poised for massive expansion in terms of both profits and global reach . what does all this tell us ? a brand new company , a popular , well - known game , one of the biggest spreads for the house , a growing market , experienced management , and a stock price that is trading under a dollar it adds up to the potential for huge gains for early investors . if youre interested in more information on the market and gaming transactions inc . , click here to read a free ten - page report . . . to join market movers mailings http : / / ggtsstock . com to find out more . first source data inc . 4535 west sahara ave # 217 las vegas nevada 89102 disclosure and disclaimer investment news indepth reports ( hereinafter inir ) , operated by first source data , inc .

"partnership mr . edward moko 18 independence close , johannesburg , south africa . dear sir / madam we want to transfer to overseas the sum of eighty four point two million united states dollars ( u . s . $ 84 . 2 , 000 , 000 . 00 ) from a bank in africa . i want to ask you to kindly look for a reliable and honest person who will be capable and fit to provide either an existing bank account or to set up a new bank account immediately to receive this money , though an empty bank account could serve this purpose as long as you will remain honest to me till the end of this important business trusting in you and believing in god that you will never let me down either now or in time to come . i am mr . edward moko . the external auditor of a bank . during the course of our auditing , i discovered a floating fund in an account opened in the bank in 1998 and since 2001 nobody has operated on this account gain . after going through some old files in the records , i discovered that the owner of the account died without a "" heir apparent to the throne "" hence the money is floating and if i do not remit this money out urgently it will be forfeited for nothing . the owner of this account who is mr . eshed . b . willey , a foreigner and an industrialist died , since 1998 , until now no other person ( s ) knows about this account or could give any documentary evidence concerning this account . as such this account has no other beneficiary and my investigation proved to me as well that eshed . b . willey until his death was the manager oriental diamond company , in south africa . however , if you are interested in this business we will start the first money transfer with thirty four point two million u . s . dollars ( u . s . $ 34 . 2 , 000 , 000 . 00 ) upon successful transaction without any disappointment from you . we shall also re -

operation to make this business a success , because the management is ready to approve this payment to any foreigner who has correct information of this account , which i will give to you , upon your positive response and once i am convinced that you are capable and will meet up with the instructions of a key bank official who is deeply involved with me in this business . i need your strong assurance that you will never let me down . with my influence and the position in the bank we can transfer this money to any foreigner ' s reliable account which you can provide with assurance that this money will be intact pending our physical arrival in your country for sharing . and to build confidence that you can come immediately to discuss with me face to face after which i will make this remittance in your presence and three of us will fly to your country at least two days ahead of the money going into the account . i will apply for annual leave to get visa immediately i hear from you that you are ready to act as directed . to prove the authenticity of the business i will use my position and influence to obtain all legal approvals for onward transfer of this money to your account with appropriate clearance from the relevant ministries , foreign exchange departments , embassy and board of internal revenue services . at the conclusion of this business , you will be given 35 % of the total amount , 60 % will be for me , while 5 % will be for expenses both parties might have incurred during this process . i look forward to your earliest reply through my email address . respectfully mr . edward moko .",1,partnership mr edward moko independence close johannesburg south africa dear sir madam want transfer overseas sum eighty four point two million united states dollars u bank africa want ask kindly look reliable honest person capable fit provide either existing bank account set new bank account immediately receive money though empty bank account could serve purpose long remain honest till end important business trusting believing god never let either time come mr edward moko external auditor bank course auditing discovered floating fund account opened bank since nobody operated account gain going old files records discovered owner account died without heir apparent throne hence money floating remit money urgently forfeited nothing owner account mr eshed b willey foreigner industrialist died since person knows account could give documentary evidence concerning account account beneficiary investigation proved well eshed b willey death manager oriental diamond company south africa however interested business start first money transfer thirty four point two million u dollars u upon successful transaction without disappointment shall also apply payment remaining amount account total amount involved eighty four point two million united states dollars u would want us make first transfer thirty four point two million united states dollar u money safe foreigners account abroad rest contacting foreigner money approved local account without valid international foreign agreement could approved foreigner valid international credentials passport drivers license foreign account sum u dollars former owner account mr eshed b willey foreigner thus money could approved foreign account however knowing reach binding agreement regards matter urgency inform next step take send private telephone fax number including full details account used deposit want us meet face face build confidence sign binding agreement bind us together transferring money account choice fund safe fly country withdrawal sharing investments need full co operation make business success management ready approve payment foreigner correct information account give upon positive response convinced capable meet instructions key bank official deeply involved business need strong assurance never let influence position bank transfer money foreigner reliable account provide assurance money intact pending physical arrival country sharing build confidence come immediately discuss face face make remittance presence three us fly country least two days ahead money going account apply annual leave get visa immediately hear ready act directed prove authenticity business use position influence obtain legal approvals onward transfer money account appropriate clearance relevant ministries foreign exchange departments embassy board internal revenue services conclusion business given total amount expenses parties might incurred process look forward earliest reply email address respectfully mr edward moko

"stephen bennett stephen bennett , professional meteorologist , was hired into the research group in september of this year as a specialist based on salary alignment criteria . in retrospect , and upon review , he should have been hired on as a senior specialist . after coming on board . it rapidly became apparent that stephen was clearly an "" under hire . "" he is well - deserving of an immediate promotion ( really more of a correction ) and pay raise , to be made retroactive at least to the lst of this month . this memo outlines the circumstances surrounding this hiring error and provides detailed justifications for this retroactive "" promotion . "" at the time of the interview process , there was no position in enron designated as "" professional meteorologist . "" in fact , the most recent similar hire prior to that date was jose marquez , also a professional meteorologist , who was hired in , based on salary alignment criteria , as a manager . while functionally , both these men are meteorologists , enron has no such job classification . compounded by the urgency in bringing on additional professional expertise in short time order , it was difficult to peg the proper enron classification appropriate for this new position . this original uncertainty and resulting misplacement of stephen into the specialist category , rather than the senior specialist category , needs to be corrected at this time . although a "" new - hire "" to enron , stephen bennett has extensive work experience . he has worked as a professional meteorologist at both the weather services corporation in boston and at the weather channel in atlanta . he came to enron well - referenced by both those organizations , needing no further training and only minimal supervision . once aboard here in houston , stephen immediately demonstrated the core enron values with our unique sense of urgency . after only a week , he assumed responsibilities normally reserved for someone actually at even a manager level - he was assigned and fully took over the critical afternoon weather briefings to the gas traders . this includes analysis and report preparation as well as presentation . also in the presentation arena , he now regularly briefs various desks in the morning and throughout the day . stephen is a master of communication and particularly adept at conveying what through other messengers might otherwise seem confusing or ambiguous . stephen has also demonstrated an unusually high level of self - initiative . he designed , implemented , and now maintains several sub - sites on the research web page which he tailored to various customers - in specific : the weather derivatives team , the agricultural team , and most recently , the crude and liquids team . i have recently assigned stephen to spearhead our conversion and major upgrade of this web page . these above described accomplishments are above and beyond stephen  , s regular duties which include starting work at 5 am daily , reliably and without fail , to assemble and prepare our trader  , s weather report . recently , with the advent of extended hours for both nymex and enrononline , stephen voluntarily on his own accord , assists in our new sunday weather support effort . as his supervisor , fully cognizant of his already standard 50 + hour work week , i do not solicit , but readily accept , this above and beyond expectations assistance . in review , the circumstance which resulted in this under hire condition was enron  , s immediate need for a non - standard , fairly unique professional - a meteorologist , coupled with stephen  , s desire to work for our company in spite of the absence of a hierarchy which included the exact entitled professional title reflecting his chosen career path . . once hired , stephen has clearly demonstrated through contribution and performance that he is well -

"urgent reply . from the desk of : barr arisman shonikon chambers & associates no 56 b . aba road , port - harcourt nigeria private email address ( @ shymail . com ) dear i sincerely apologize for intruding into your privacy especially by contacting you through this means for a business transaction of this magnitude , but due to its seriousness and urgency it therefore became necessary for me to seek your assistance . i am barr . arisman shonikon , the personal lawyer to late mr . frank ionescu , a foreigner , who worked with an oil servicing company in the oil rich niger delta area of bayelsa state . i am contacting you concerning my late client and an investment he made . i would respectfully request that you keep the contents of this mail confidential and respect the integrity of the information you come by as a result of this mail . i contacted you independently and no one should be informed of this communication . i would like to intimate you with certain facts that i believe would be of interest to you . this is a genuine transaction and is 100 % risk free . all i ' m demanding from you is your honest co - operation to enable us achieve our goal , and not a perfidious person . on the 6 th of may , 2002 it was reported to us that my client , his wife and their only daughter were involved in a local plane crash at kano state , enroot abuja ( the capital city ) all occupants in the plane lost their lives , unfortunately on this same flight were other dignitaries like the sports minister and a host of others meanwhile , until his death , my late client had a fixed deposit account of usd $ 15 . million deposited in a security company ( unic security company ) here . recently , i received an ultimatum from the security company asking me to provide my late client ' s relative so that the money would be given to them . but unfortunately it was discovered that my late client did not declare any identifiable family member in all the official documents he tendered to the security company while opening the account . therefore , this development leaves me as the only person with the full picture of what the prevailing situation is in relation to the deposit my late client made and who is entitled to be the bona fide beneficiary / next of kin or relative because he died intestate . therefore , if i fail to locate any of his relatives or his next of kin ( and have this money transferred to them ) the security company will at the expiration of the 6 weeks ultimatum given to me confiscate the account . according to the ultimatum issued to me by the security company , if i fail to present to them my late client ' s relative , with a legitimate statement of claim for the money before the given time they will confiscate the account and the money declared ' unclaimed balance ' . this will result in the money being taken over by the security company . this will not happen if i have my way . since i have been unsuccessful in locating the relatives of my late client all these while , my proposal , therefore , is to present you as the next of kin / relative of my client due to the fact that you are a foreigner and can easily pass as a possible relative of my client . i know you will be wondering how possible this could be but i assure you that this is simple . i therefore seek your consent to present you as the next of kin to my client so that the money he deposited with the security company would be paid to you and there after you and i will share the money 40 % for you and i will be taking 60 % . i assure you that the deposit would be released to you within a few days because i have all the relevant information that would facilitate that will be required on documentation . first , i will like you to provide immediately the following information : your full names . contact address . telephone / fax numbers . with this information i will prepare the necessary documents and affidavit that will put you in place as the next of kin . after we have successfully satisfied the requirements of the bank the money totaling usd 15 . million would be paid into your account for you to take 40 % and i will be taking 60 % . all i require is your honest co - operation to enable us see this through . there is no risk at all because everything would be done legally and my position as a qualified attorney will facilitate everything . secondly , i will give you all the necessary documents that would serve as evidence proving that you are the next of kin / relative of my late client . these documents will legally conferm on you the status to act as the beneficiary of the estate of my late client . what i related to you might smack of unethical practice but i want you to understand that this is a once in life time opportunity capable of turning around our situation . the truth is that this money would not be taken by the government but by some greedy security company officials and i would not fold my arms and watch this happen hence my decision to contact you . if you are interested in doing this transaction with me kindly send your reply to this email address : ( arismanshonikon @ shymail . com ) thank you as i await your positive response . barr . arisman shonikon .",1,urgent reply desk barr arisman shonikon chambers associates b aba road port harcourt nigeria private email address shymail com dear sincerely apologize intruding privacy especially contacting means business transaction magnitude due seriousness urgency therefore became necessary seek assistance barr arisman shonikon personal lawyer late mr frank ionescu foreigner worked oil servicing company oil rich niger delta area bayelsa state contacting concerning late client investment made would respectfully request keep contents mail confidential respect integrity information come result mail contacted independently one informed communication would like intimate certain facts believe would interest genuine transaction risk free demanding honest co operation enable us achieve goal perfidious person th may reported us client wife daughter involved local plane crash kano state enroot abuja capital city occupants plane lost lives unfortunately flight dignitaries like sports minister host others meanwhile death late client fixed deposit account usd million deposited security company unic security company recently received ultimatum security company asking provide late client relative money would given unfortunately discovered late client declare identifiable family member official documents tendered security company opening account therefore development leaves person full picture prevailing situation relation deposit late client made entitled bona fide beneficiary next kin relative died intestate therefore fail locate relatives next kin money transferred security company expiration weeks ultimatum given confiscate account according ultimatum issued security company fail present late client relative legitimate statement claim money given time confiscate account money declared unclaimed balance result money taken security company happen way since unsuccessful locating relatives late client proposal therefore present next kin relative client due fact foreigner easily pass possible relative client know wondering possible could assure simple therefore seek consent present next kin client money deposited security company would paid share money taking assure deposit would released within days relevant information would facilitate required documentation first like provide immediately following information full names contact address telephone fax numbers information prepare necessary documents affidavit put place next kin successfully satisfied requirements bank money totaling usd million would paid account take taking require honest co operation enable us see risk everything would done legally position qualified attorney facilitate everything secondly give necessary documents would serve evidence proving next kin relative late client documents legally conferm status act beneficiary estate late client related might smack unethical practice want understand life time opportunity capable turning around situation truth money would taken government greedy security company officials would fold arms watch happen hence decision contact interested transaction kindly send reply email address arismanshonikon shymail com thank await positive response barr arisman shonikon

"" so many times that sensible people have learned to discount such claims . but now a bona fide wolf has arrived , whose predatory behavior is doing terrible damage to our most populous state  * and nobody will believe it . true , california would be heading for a summer of power shortages even if it had never deregulated . and even if there was workable competition in the wholesale electricity market , prices in that market would spike during periods of peak demand , transferring billions of dollars from either taxpayers or consumers to the generators . but the evidence is now overwhelming that there isn ' t workable competition in california ' s power market , and that the actions of generators "" gaming the system "" have greatly magnified the crisis . the key fact is that california has somehow remained in a state of more or less continuous power shortage and very high wholesale prices regardless of the level of demand . a rash of outages has kept the electricity market conveniently  * and very profitably  * short of supply even during periods of low demand , when there ought to be lots of excess capacity . as frank wolak , the stanford economist who also advises the state ' s power grid , has pointed out , an outage at a power plant is a lot like an employee calling in sick . you can ' t tell directly whether he is really sick or has chosen to take the day off for other reasons , but you can look for circumstantial evidence . and such evidence has convinced mr . wolak that "" generators use forced outages strategically to withhold capacity from the market ""  * a view shared by a growing number of other researchers . which brings us to the latest move by the federal energy regulatory commission . on wednesday , the commission apparently decided to offer california some relief , and put new price caps in place on the california electricity market . i say "" apparently "" because the more you look at the plan the less likely it seems to be any help at all . indeed , the measure was passed on a 2 - to - 1 vote , with william massey  * the one commissioner who has been sympathetic to calls for price controls  * voting against it on the grounds that it would be ineffectual . what ' s wrong with ferc ' s plan ? first , it caps prices only in emergency conditions  * ignoring the fact that electricity prices have stayed at hard - to - explain levels even when there is no emergency . in effect , the plan is laid out as if the electricity market were really competitive , in spite of all the evidence that it is not . second , even those emergency price caps are full of loopholes , offering extensive opportunities for what mr . wolak calls "" megawatt laundering ""  * selling power to affiliated companies that for one reason or another are exempted from the price controls ( for example , the controls do not apply to "" imports "" from neighboring states ) , then selling it back into the california market . severin borenstein of the university of california energy institute adds that because the allowed price depends on the cost of generation at the least efficient plant , generators will have a clear incentive to produce inefficiently : "" i predict we will find some plants we never heard of before that are suddenly operating again , and they will be pretty inefficient . "" the general verdict seems to be that this is not a serious plan . there are serious proposals to mitigate the crisis out there  * indeed , last fall mr . wolak submitted a proposal that was well received by other experts  * but ferc has ignored all of them . the charitable interpretation is that ferc still doesn ' t get it , that it just can ' t bring itself to believe that this time the wolf is real . the uncharitable interpretation is that last week ' s action was meant to fail . the medley report , an online newsletter , calls the ferc plan "" a grand exercise in posturing without substance . . . a very clever temporary move by the bush administration to deflect any political fallout "" from the looming disaster . whatever the explanation , the plain fact is that ferc and the administration have yet to offer california any significant relief . 00 fo 04 b 3 blabf visit nytimes . com for complete access to the most authoritative news coverage on the web , updated throughout the day . become a member today ! it ' s free ! http : / / www . nytimes . com ?

"come on ! it ' s fun and easy ! ! * * * please read this email to the end * * * try it . just for fun . it will cost you 25 $ to earn at least thousands of dollars ! ! ! this thing is legal because you are buying and selling something of value : marketing reports . there is my true story . i received by email the instructions include in this letter . it interests me because the system was quite simple . in the list of people selling the reports ( as you will see above ) , there was a guy living not so far . i searched for his phone number and i called him . i just wanted to know if this system was really working . he told me his business was going very well and he was receiving from 50 $ to 150 $ in cash everyday ! that ' s why i went into this thing ! thank ' s to the computer age and the internet ! be an internet millionaire like others within a year ! ! ! before you say ' ' bull ' ' , please read the following . this is the letter you have been hearing about on the news lately . due to the popularity of this letter on the internet , a national weekly news program recently devoted an entire show to the investigation of this program described below , to see if it really can make people money . the show also investigated whether or not the program was legal . their findings proved once and for all that there are ' ' absolutely no laws prohibiting the participation in the program and if people can "" follow the simple instruction "" they are bound to make some mega bucks with only $ 25 out of pocket cost ' ' . = = print this now for your future reference = = if you would like to make at least $ 500 , 000 every 4 to 5 months easily and comfortably , please read the following . . . then read it again and again ! ! ! follow the simple instruction below and your financial dreams will come true , guaranteed ! instructions : = = = = = order all 5 reports shown on the list below = = = = = for each report , send $ 5 cash , the name & number of the report you are ordering and your e - mail address to the person whose name appears on that list next to the report . make sure your return address is on your envelope top left corner in case of any mail problems . = = = when you place your order , make sure = = = = = = you order each of the 5 reports ! = = = you will need all 5 reports so that you can save them on your computer and resell them . your total cost $ 5 x 5 = $ 25 . 00 . within a few days you will receive , via e - mail , each of the 5 reports from these 5 different individuals . save them on your computer so they will be accessible for you to send to the 1 , 000 ' s of people who will order them from you . also make a floppy of these reports and keep it on your desk in case something happens to your computer . important - do not alter the names of the people who are listed next to each report , or their sequence on the list , in any way other than what is instructed below in step ' ' 1 through 6 ' ' or you will loose out on the majority of your profits . once you understand the way this works , you will also see how it does not work if you change it . remember , this method has been tested , and if you alter it , it will not work ! ! ! people have tried to put their friends / relatives names on all five thinking they could get all the money . but it does not work this way . believe us , some have tried to be greedy and then nothing happened . so do not try to change anything other than what is instructed . because if you do , it will not work for you . remember , honesty reaps the reward ! ! ! this is a legitimate business . you are offering a product for sale and getting paid for it . treat it as such and you will be very profitable in a short period of time . 1 . . after you have ordered all 5 reports , take this advertisement and remove the name & address of the person in report # 5 . this person has made it through the cycle and is no doubt counting their fortune . 2 . . move the name & address in report # 4 down to report # 5 . 3 . . move the name & address in report # 3 down to report # 4 . 4 . . move the name & address in report # 2 down to report # 3 . 5 . . move the name & address in report # 1 down to report # 2 6 . . . . insert your name & address in the report # 1 position . please make sure you copy every name & address accurately ! this is critical to your success . take this entire letter , with the modified list of names , and save it on your computer . do not make any other changes . save this on a disk as well just in case if you loose any data . to assist you with marketing your business on the internet , the 5 reports you purchase will provide you with invaluable marketing information which includes how to send bulk e - mails legally , where to find thousands of free classified ads and much more . there are 2 primary methods to get this venture going : method # 1 : by sending bulk e - mail legally let ' s say that you decide to start small , just to see how it goes , and we will assume you and those involved send out only 5 , 000 e - mails each . let ' s also assume that the mailing receive only a 0 . 2 % ( 2 / 10 of 1 % ) response ( the response could be much better but lets just say it is only 0 . 2 % ) . also many peoplewill send out hundreds of thousands e - mails instead of only 5 , 000 each ) . continuing with this example , you send out only 5 , 000 e - mails . with a 0 . 2 % response , that is only 10 orders for report # 1 . those 10 people responded by sending out 5 , 000 e - mail each for a total of 50 , 000 . out of those 50 , 000 e - mails only 0 . 2 % responded with orders . that ' s = 100 people responded and ordered report # 2 . those 100 people mail out 5 , 000 e - mails each for a total of 500 , 000 e - mails . the 0 . 2 % response to that is 1000 orders for report # 3 . those 1000 people send 5 , 000 e - mail each for a total of 5 million e - mail sent out . the 0 . 2 % response is 10 , 000 orders for report # 4 . those 10 , 000 people send out 5 , 000 e - mails each for a total of 50 , 000 , 000 ( 50 million ) e - mails . the 0 . 2 % response to that is 100 , 000 orders for report # 5 . that ' s 100 , 000 orders times $ 5 each = $ 500 , 000 . 00 ( half a million dollars ) . your total income in this example is : 1 . . . . . $ 50 + 2 . . . . . $ 500 + 3 . . . . . $ 5 , 000 + 4 . . . . . $ 50 , 000 + 5 . . . . $ 500 , 000 . . . . grand total = $ 555 , 550 . 00 numbers do not lie . get a pencil & paper and figure out the worst possible responses and no matter how you calculate it , you will still make a lot of money ! remember friend , this is assuming only 10 people ordering out of 5 , 000 you mailed to . dare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone or half or even one 4 th of those people mailed 100 , 000 e - mails each or more ? there are over 150 million people on the internet worldwide and counting , with thousands more coming on line every day . believe me , many people will do just that , and more ! method # 2 : by placing free ads on the internet advertising on the net is very , very inexpensive and there are hundreds of free places to advertise . placing a lot of free ads on the internet will easily get a larger response . we strongly suggest you start with method # 1 and add method # 2 as you go along . for every $ 5 you receive , all you must do is e - mail them the report they ordered . that ' s it . always provide same day service on all orders . this will guarantee that the e - mail they send out , with your name and address on it , will be prompt because they can not advertise until they receive the report . = = = = = = = = = = = available reports = = = = = = = = = = = = = = the reason for the "" cash "" is not because this is illegal or somehow "" wrong "" . it is simply about time . time for checks or credit cards to be cleared or approved , etc . concealing it is simply so no one can see there is money in the envelope and steal it before it gets to you . order each report by its number & name only . notes : always send $ 5 cash ( u . s . currency ) for each report . checks not accepted . make sure the cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least 2 sheets of paper . on one of those sheets of paper , write the number & the name of the report you are ordering , your e - mail address and your name and postal address . place your order for these reports now : = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = report # 1 : ' the insider ' s guide to advertising for free on the net order report # 1 from : y . l . wong p . o . box no . 71819 kowloon central post office hong kong report # 2 : the insider ' s guide to sending bulk email on the net order report # 2 from : martin veronneau c . p . 70058 laval , quebec h 7 r 5 z 2 canada report # 3 : secret to multilevel marketing on the net order report # 3 from : francis kidd p . o . box 209 homestead , pa 15120 usa report # 4 : how to become a millionaire using mlm & the net order report # 4 from : m . l . frayser p . o . box 61432 fort myers , fl 33906 usa report # 5 : how to send out one million emails for free order report # 5 from : stone evans 600 n . pearl , suite gl 03 dallas , tx 75201 usa $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ your success guidelines $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ follow these guidelines to guarantee your success : = = = if you do not receive at least 10 orders for report # 1 within 2 weeks , continue sending e - mails until you do . = = = after you have received 10 orders , 2 to 3 weeks after that you should receive 100 orders or more for report # 2 . if you did not , continue advertising or sending e - mails until you do . * * once you have received 100 or more orders for report # 2 , you can relax , because the system is already working for you , and the cash will continue to roll in ! this is important to remember : every time your name is moved down on the list , you are placed in front of a different report . you can keep track of your progress by watching which report people are ordering from you . if you want to generate more income send another batch of e - mails and start the whole process again . there is no limit to the income you can generate from this business ! ! ! following is a note from the originator of this program : you have just received information that can give you financial freedom for the rest of your life , with no risk and just a little bit of effort . you can make more money in the next few weeks and months than you have ever imagined . follow the program exactly as instructed . do not change it in any way . it works exceedingly well as it is now . remember to e - mail a copy of this exciting report after you have put your name and address in report # 1 and moved others to # 2 . . . . . # 5 as instructed above . one of the people you send this to may send out 100 , 000 or more e - mails and your name will be on every one of them . remember though , the more you send out the more potential customers you will reach . so my friend , i have given you the ideas , information , materials and opportunity to become financially independent . it is up to you now !

relatively small strategic asset position . second , we need to significantly streamline corporate reporting relationships . particularly with joe sutton  , s departure , the ability to directly manage the day - to - day activities of 15 independent business units has become increasingly difficult . third , we need to accomplish these changes without , in any way , compromising the ongoing profitability of all our businesses and without delaying or hindering our effort to monetize a significant portion of our lower - yielding asset positions . and fourth , as always , we need to take

"urgent response dear sir / madam , you may be surprised to receive this letter from me , since you don ' t know me personally . i am mrs maria da costa the wife of dr . john da costa , who was recently murdered in the land dispute in zimbabwe , i got your contact through network on line in my search for a reliable and reputable person to handle a very confidential transaction which involves a transfer of a fund to a foreign account and i decided to write you . my late husband was among the zimbabwean rich farmers murdered in cold blood by the agents of the ruling government of president robert mugabe for his alleged support and sympathy for the zimbabwean opposition party controlled by the white minority . before his death he deposited the sum of us $ 15 . 2 million ( fifteen million two hundred thousand us dollars ) to south africa with a security company as if he foresaw the looming danger in zimbabwe . the money was deposited in a din box as valuables to avoid much demurrage from the security company . this money was embarked from the purchase of new machinery and chemical for farms and establishment of new farms in lesotho and swaziland . the land problem arose when president robert mugabe introduced a new land act that wholly affected the rich white farmers and some few blacks vehemently condemned the "" modus operandi "" adopted by the government . this resulted to rampant killing and mob action by the war veterans and some political thugs , precisely ; more than fifty - one ( 51 ) people have so far been killed . heads of governments from the west , especially britain and united states of america have voiced their condemnation of mugabe ' s plan , subsequently , south african development community ( s . a . d . c . ) has continuously supported mugabe ' s new land act , it is against this background that i and my family who are currently residing in south africa have decided to transfer my husband ' s money into a foreign account . as a family , i am saddled with the responsibility of seeking a genuine foreign account , where this money could be transferred without the knowledge of my government who is tactically freezing of our family wealth . and south africa ' s government seems to be playing along with them . i am faced with the dilemma of investing this money in south africa for fear of encountering the same experience in future since both countries have almost the same political history . more so , the south african foreign exchange policy does not allow such investment hence we are seeking for an "" asylum "" . as a business person whom i would entrust my future and that of my family into his hands , i must let you know that this transaction is 100 % risk free and that the nature of your business does not necessarily matter . for your assistance , i will offering you 15 % of the total sum , 80 % for my family while 5 % will be mapped out for any expenses we may incur during the course of this transaction . i wish to invest our part of the money on commercial property based on your advice . finally , all i demand from you is assurance that you will not do away with this money when it finally gets to your personal or company ' s account in your country . if this proposal is acceptable by you , please confirm your interest by contacting us on this phone number + 27724263169 or e - mail address mariadacosta _ 2002 @ yahoo . com best regards , mrs maria da costa ( for the family )",1,urgent response dear sir madam may surprised receive letter since know personally mrs maria da costa wife dr john da costa recently murdered land dispute zimbabwe got contact network line search reliable reputable person handle confidential transaction involves transfer fund foreign account decided write late husband among zimbabwean rich farmers murdered cold blood agents ruling government president robert mugabe alleged support sympathy zimbabwean opposition party controlled white minority death deposited sum us million fifteen million two hundred thousand us dollars south africa security company foresaw looming danger zimbabwe money deposited din box valuables avoid much demurrage security company money embarked purchase new machinery chemical farms establishment new farms lesotho swaziland land problem arose president robert mugabe introduced new land act wholly affected rich white farmers blacks vehemently condemned modus operandi adopted government resulted rampant killing mob action war veterans political thugs precisely fifty one people far killed heads governments west especially britain united states america voiced condemnation mugabe plan subsequently south african development community c continuously supported mugabe new land act background family currently residing south africa decided transfer husband money foreign account family saddled responsibility seeking genuine foreign account money could transferred without knowledge government tactically freezing family wealth south africa government seems playing along faced dilemma investing money south africa fear encountering experience future since countries almost political history south african foreign exchange policy allow investment hence seeking asylum business person would entrust future family hands must let know transaction risk free nature business necessarily matter assistance offering total sum family mapped expenses may incur course transaction wish invest part money commercial property based advice finally demand assurance away money finally gets personal company account country proposal acceptable please confirm interest contacting us phone number e mail address mariadacosta yahoo com best regards mrs maria da costa family

"industry giants can ' t match this opportunity another ground breaking news alert from rlyc . the potential stored - value debit card market in the united states alone is approximately 150 million people , of which only about 12 million now maintain active stored - value debit card accounts . one company is quickly entering a $ 2 trillion market space with a proposed portfolio of product and service offerings that even the largest multi - national corporations in its industry may have a hard time matching . in just a few months , this company has begun adding and developing innovative new products and targeting acquisitions that could help it reach millions of new long - term customers that could generate tremendous re - occurring revenues for many years to come . although you have probably never heard of this company , you may soon hear of it even if you don ' t continue reading this message . that ' s because it is making a major push to put its products in the hands of a half million people in the u . s . within the next year . an upstart company to make a real impact in a two trillion dollar industry in reality , this company ' s lack of early recognition could be a major plus for you . since the overwhelming majority of investors and institutions don ' t know this company or what they plan to accomplish , their stock is trading at rock bottom prices . but , if they do accomplish even a small part of what they have set out to do over the coming months and years , this company could become a significant player in its trillion dollar industry and its stock reflect its accomplishments . the company that we ' ll introduce you to today is ( relay capital corp . pink sheets : rlyc ) . rlyc , which recently went public , is a multi - faceted financial services company that focuses primarily on the stored value card market . rlyc ' s present product and service offerings include pre - paid stored - value cards , reward cards , employee payroll cards , gift , retail and affinity group cards , travel cards and funds transfer cards . these services are aimed at a significant market both domestically and internationally . just because a company is in a large and growing industry doesn ' t necessarily ensure that it will be a winner . in order to be successful , that company also needs to be truly innovative , have very strong partners , be able to reach vast customer bases and have a management team capable of putting it all together and turning its goals into reality . rlyc appears to be that company . below we ' ll discuss this substantial potential market rlyc is after and what sets rlyc apart from the competition . the potential stored - value debit card market in the united states alone is approximately 150 million people , of which only about 12 million now maintain active stored - value debit card accounts . stored - value cards have the potential to help the 50 million adults and their families who have been excluded from the e - commerce revolution because they do not have access to credit or banking facilities . the implications reverberate across industry segments . estimates suggest stored - value transactions could exceed $ 2 trillion in just a few years . rlyc ' s focus is on providing stored - value cards to the un - banked and under - banked . these terms refer to consumers that that do not have a bank account , debit card . the size of that group is staggering that ' s about one - third of the nation ' s work force ! rlyc capitalizes on the dilemma these consumers face by providing stored - value card programs that make it easy , fast and secure for people and businesses to buy all manners of goods and services using stored - value cards as well as for the un - banked and under - banked to be paid their salaries via the same cards . but that ' s not all . the benefits relay will offer on its stored value cards as well as other financial services will also be of great benefit to those who already have banking relationships . in this segment , relay plans to offer more services with greater convenience for less cost to the consumer . who wouldn ' t want that ? the payroll market is another enormous market for rlyc for the under - and un - banked , collecting their pay , cashing payroll checks and then paying bills with those funds can be extremely complicated and time consuming . rlyc ' s stored - value pay transfer card program presents a very effective and innovative solution for this problem . rlyc ' s pay transfer card program can lower costs to employers to process payroll for the banked and the un - banked alike ! lower costs to cardholders to potentially transfer cash between u . s . cards , cards in foreign countries , and services bought through the cards , improved employee retention , improved customer retention will all be available thanks to rlyc . various programs will make life much easier for cardholders using the system , while also providing the convenience and flexibility of either visa or mastercard purchasing power or 24 hour access to their money through atms . rlyc signs loi with national staffing company to use its pay transfer cards earlier this year , rlyc signed a binding letter of intent to provide a pay transfer card program for asgard global resources llc ( click to go to their site ) , a leader in providing technical , craft and administrative staffing services to businesses , industry and government through locations in houston , dallas , long island , orlando , phoenix and southern california all areas with huge un - and under - banked populations . the potential market for this service is really big . it includes large employers , companies that process payroll and financial institutions that provide banking and payroll services to commercial customers . this system will simplify payments to widely dispersed employees and contractors while dramatically decreasing payroll distribution by offering a cost effective alternative to printing , cutting , and mailing paper payroll checks . it also helps to reduce a great deal of paper processing of checks and pay , eliminate lost checks , stop payments and minimize fraud . but best of all , this should help to significantly boost rlyc ' s revenues . $ 150 billion sent worldwide by relatives to home countries mexicans in u . s . send $ 16 . 3 billion a year back to mexico with $ 150 billion being transferred internationally each year , remittances are a really big business . in times past , people wanting to send money to relatives back in their home countries had few choices . many times their only choice was an expensive proposition like western union . more recently , more and more people have resorted to purchasing and mailing money orders in order to try to cut down on the cost of sending remittances . the problems with traditional money transfer methods with wire services , there are any number of inherent problems when trying to send money to relatives overseas . first , wiring funds across borders can be expensive . this can make it very cost - prohibitive to send smaller amounts of cash and often means that relatives must wait longer to receive their remittances because the sender has to save up until the amount is large enough to warrant the cost associated with the wire service . next there is the problem of logistics . both the sender and the recipient must be able to easily reach a storefront that offers the same wire company ' s services . even if they both are able to do this , the recipient may have to make multiple trips to the wire service office to check to see if their funds have cleared yet and can be released to them . lastly , the sender and the recipient are subjected to varying service fees depending on which wire service they choose . these fees can be very high and can significantly cut into the amount of money the recipient ultimately receives . so , even though using a wire service may be a fairly fast way to transfer money , it can be very expensive and logistically difficult to use . with money orders there is always the problem of mail service . although in america we have grown accustomed to relatively quick and reliable mail service , this is not always the case in foreign countries . this is especially true in underdeveloped nations , where most remittances are sent . a letter containing a remittance that a family is depending on to provide much needed food and shelter could take many days or even weeks to arrive . and , there is always the chance that it will never arrive at its destination at all , meaning that the sender ' s family could go hungry or end up on the streets . what is the best way to send remittances ? by far the most convenient , fast , safe and ultimately cost efficient method to send remittances is through a stored - value card . with this type of service , a person can easily activate a card and then just deposit funds into the account ( onto the card ) via loading station , telephone or the internet for easy use by relatives in his or her home country . the process is extremely easy and cost - effective . funds can be added to the card ' s account at an ever increasing number of convenient locations . the family member overseas can then draw down on those funds by presenting a card from that account to make purchases or they can use the card to withdraw cash from atms . it could not be any simpler . rlyc has already begun filling orders in june of this year , rlyc announced that it had received its first order for 2 , 000 pin - based stored value cards . the company stated that its growth estimates call for approximately 2 , 000 new stored - value cards being put into circulation each month . this could result in exponential revenue growth as new customers are added and its customers take advantage of its other financial services . moreover , though other programs it is working on , it could have one half million cards in the market within the next 18 months . rlyc plans to expand its services through partner companies and one - stop financial centers rlyc expects to fuel exponential growth of recurring revenue from individual card usage , monthly fees , as well as other activities occurring at its loading centers or the virtual financial centers it is planning . loading centers are retail locations , such as convenience stores , check cashing facilities or other types of retail facilities serving to dispense or receive cash facilitating transactions for the debit card consumer . rlyc has already established strategic relationships with leading card processors , vendors and distributors , and is in program development with key partners that may bring over 100 , 000 retail locations and a host of great opportunities to dramatically increase its brand recognition . rlyc plans a host of new financial products and service offerings some of the products and services rlyc plans to be launching in the coming months include commercial , auto and sba loans , mortgages , all types of affinity group ( loyalty / rewards ) cards , pharmacy discount cards , certificates of deposit ( cd ' s ) , health savings accounts and health and life insurance . rylc is expanding extremely rapidly and at this pace , should gain a whole lot of exposure to the investment community f - a - s - t ! ! ! rlyc plans to grow through joint ventures and acquisitions through a well - planned strategy to partner with major players in the financial services industry and through key acquisitions of complimentary companies , rlyc plans to fuel its growth . it has begun identifying and will negotiate business joint ventures , acquisitions and partnerships within the stored value card industry . rlyc is positioned to offer expanded payroll products as well as define a niche market for its private label stored value solutions . with corporate network ' s assistance , it expects to add new and expansive products linked to its card platform and provide its customers with a growing range of superior products and increased customer loyalty . rlyc plans to enter the emerging high growth health savings account ( hsa ) market rlyc has entered into an agreement in principle with mydaily corp . , an employee benefit and financial services company , to provide health saving account ( hsa ) stored value debit cards that will enable employees to easily pay routine medical bills with pre - tax dollars . health savings accounts ( hsa ) are tax - sheltered savings accounts similar to an ira , but earmarked for medical expenses and are part of a high deductible insurance plan . deposits are 100 % tax - deductible for the self - employed and for employees of companies that offer an hsa . this could be an enormous new market for rlyc it is estimated that all millions of non - elderly americans will soon have access to a health savings account , creating a market of unprecedented potential . in fact , due to the rising costs of employer - sponsored health plans , it is also estimated that one in every two major employers in the united states is considering consumer directed health plans and hsa for their employees . experienced stored value card and financial services industry executive named ceo of relay capital corp . e . reese bogle iii , experienced financial services and stored value card industry executive , has been named relay ' s . most recently he was one of the founders , and served as executive vice president and chief operating officer of interstate net bank ( www . isnbank . com ) , establishing it as a visa principal member . prior to this , mr . bogle , was vp of e * trade bank ' s corporate development and strategic alliances group and president of telebanc insurance services , inc . he also served as vp and marketing director of premium bank , and held a variety of managerial and marketing positions at leading financial services companies . relay will be adding real depth experience to its management team the next step is to bring a well qualified management team to relay capital said mr . bogle . once the team is onboard , we intend to build relay capital into a diversified financial services provider that , in addition to looking for exponential growth of recurring revenue generated from individual stored card usage , as well as other financial service activities occurring at our card loading centers or its virtual financial centers , we potentially plan to provide : commercial loans , auto loans , sba loans , mortgages , certificates of deposit ( cd ' s ) , health benefits ( dental , vision ) , life insurance benefits , pharmacy drug discounts , loyalty and reward programs , and shopping discount programs . with innovative products and services targeted to trillion dollar market ; a host of powerful partners ; key acquisitions in the works ; orders already coming in ; and a top - notch management team to bring it all together , rlyc seems to be headed for sunny skies . this company will not remain below the radar screens of wall street ' s mover shakers or even the average investor for much longer . . . if you are on the lookout for companies that have what it takes to experience rapid growth , but are still trading at rock bottom prices , you should call your financial advisor today about relay capital corp .

"california update 4 / 27 / 01 the following report contains confidential and sensitive information . please treat with discretion . executive summary : ? ferc price cap decision reflects bush political and economic objectives . politically , bush is determined to let the crisis blame fall on davis ; from an economic perspective , he is unwilling to create disincentives for new power generation ? davis finds four major flaws with ferc plan , most notably its exclusion of out - of - state generators ? june lst "" kill clause "" for ferc order could coincide with new bush regional plan ? california facing growing fiscal risk following bond downgrade , expected $ 20 billion power bill this summer - - economic crisis would force deeper administration involvement ? qf bid for advance payments from pg & e likely to fail in bankruptcy court ? new generation delays probable because of state / qf squabbling ? consumer groups are preparing a constitutional challenge to socal bailout deal 1 . ferc fallout the ferc decision is a holding move by the bush administration that looks like action , but is not . rather , it allows the situation in california to continue to develop virtually unabated . the political strategy appears to allow the situation to deteriorate to the point where davis cannot escape shouldering the blame . once they are politically inoculated , the administration can begin to look at regional solutions . moreover , the administration has already made explicit ( and will certainly restate in the forthcoming cheney commission report ) its opposition to stronger price caps on the grounds that they are unwilling to create disincentives to the construction of new generation . it is interesting and ironic to note that electricity generators were generally happy with the ferc order and that the only ferc commissioner who favors price caps actually voted against this plan . 2 . something less than effective price caps from davis ' s point of view , the ferc plan has four major flaws : ? the order applies only to california , not to the rest of the west . non - california generators are not required to sell at capped rates to california . ? as the order is written , it is more of a price floor for emergency power than a ceiling . ? state officials also believe that energy suppliers will continue to game the system , because the price mitigation scheme only kicks in after a stage 2 emergency and does not require any collusion . ? even when the price caps kick in , they are based on the cost - plus for the highest cost producer supplying power to california and do not require wholesalers to abide by the cap . the generators can also charge above the cap , provided they can subsequently justify the excess charge to ferc . 3 . proposal "" kill clause "" adds to the political dilemma for davis the ferc proposal includes a "" kill clause "" that says the caps will be withdrawn unless california ' s iso agrees by june lst to become part of the regional grid now under ferc control . if davis doesn ' t sign on to the regional grid by june lst , then he will have to live with june 2 nd headlines blaming him for letting the "" bush price caps plan "" collapse . 4 . growing fiscal risk in california sources speculate that california could therefore pay as much as $ 20 billion on power this summer - this is more than the combined enterprise value of pg & e and sce . these sources believe that , because of the severity of the situation , the ferc and / or the federal government will be forced to take further action to control prices for power . the consensus is that the state of california will run out of money in about 90 days . one of the first projects to be cancelled will be state plans to finance new power plant construction in exchange for long - term power deals . the bleak fiscal picture is also causing bank creditors to revisit the bridge loans they are providing to california . the bush administration and the fed are only now waking up to the seriousness of the fiscal picture . the country ' s largest and most prosperous state will have gone from large surpluses to serious debt downgrades and devastating deficits in a matter of months . 5 . qfs to seek advance payment from pg & e meanwhile , on the bankruptcy front , the qfs reportedly will ask the bankruptcy judge today to give them advance payment from pge ' s accounts , since their natural gas vendors have likewise demanded advance payment for gas . it appears very unlikely that the qfs ' request will be granted . if the qfs do not receive advance payment , it is likely that most of the 4 , 000 mw of gas - fired qf capacity will remain offline . 6 delays likely in new qf generation the qf deals made with the state for long - term contracts are being continually renegotiated , which is likely to mean that the new plants those contracts are supposed to finance will not be online as early as anticipated . 7 . consumer groups ready to challenge constitutionality of sce bailout plan harvey rosenfield and his colleagues reportedly have been reviewing an analysis of the mou for the sce bailout plan . the analysis was done by a utilities analyst , rather than a lawyer , though it appears to raise a number of good legal points . for example , one of the elements of the mou is a "" non - bypassable "" charge on ratepayers that would require them to pay even if they disconnect from the grid . this is effectively a tax , since there is no exchange of value for money , which under the ca constitution cannot be used to directly benefit a private entity . this makes the bonds that would be issued are general obligation bonds , rather than revenue bonds . according to the constitution , the state cannot be put into debt to benefit a private company . for this and other reasons , even if the republicans would vote for the sce bailout , which remains unlikely , the bailout probably would not stand a likely constitutional challenge . 8 . governor hurt by continued failure to disclose long -

"auctions with an incumbent ' s right of first refusal shelley , my colleague , clayton vernon , who has a background in economics , wrote a short summary of arguments against the rofr . we are working on the second approach to the problem : we try to come up with a numerical estimate of the value of this option . the fact that an incumbent shipper has this option has distributional consequences : he has something of value he never paid for . having a numerical estimate of the value of this option could help to argue against it . the value of such an option is case specific ; so we shall rather produce a template you can use for valuation case by case . vince kaminski - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - forwarded by vince j kaminski / hou / ect on 01 / 20 / 2000 08 : 34 am - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - clayton vernon @ enron 01 / 20 / 2000 08 : 29 am to : vince j kaminski / hou / ect @ ect cc : stinson gibner / hou / ect @ ect , zlu / hou / ect @ ect subject : auctions with an incumbent ' s right of first refusal vince - here is an essay on the issue you are discussing : the adverse economic impact of "" rights of first refusal "" an option to "" first refuse "" to match a competitor ' s offer is a restraint of free trade and an impediment to efficiency in the marketplace . this economic conclusion is unambiguous . if an "" incumbent "" has the right to match an offer made by a competitor , for an item or service of value , then few competitors will invest the time and expense necessary to prepare and submit offers , those offers will be lower than they would have been otherwise , and the contract will often be awarded to an inefficient incumbent instead of a more efficient challenger . in a traditional auction , where all bids are sealed and the item up for auction is awarded to the highest bidder , we can safely predict the item will be awarded to the bidder who values it the most , at a price reflecting the full value of the item up for auction . this is the efficient result in a market economy , because the financing of the high bid reflects resources freely allocated to the high bidder . if the auction has open bids , we can again safely predict the item to be awarded to the correct bidder , albeit at a slightly lower price to the donor of the item since the bidder with the highest valuation can simply increment by an infinitesimal amount the second - highest valuation . now , in a modified auction , where an incumbent bidder has the right to match the highest bid and retain the item for himself , each competing bidder must justify his own due diligence and bid preparation expenses against the following , and likely , scenario : the incumbent does not spend himself for due diligence , but instead uses these savings to help finance his matching the top bid from a competitor . simply put , the incumbent with a "" right of first refusal "" can be safely predicted to simply match their competitor ' s bid by "" rule of thumb . "" but the incumbent ' s valuation of the item up for auction can be less than the valuation of the competitor , by the amount of the due diligence and administrative expenses . and , the incumbent firm expropriates the expertise of his competitors , not only in their valuations themselves , a nontrivial financial exercise , but in any operational details required to be submitted along with the bid . furthermore , in an esoteric concept known as the "" winner ' s curse , "" a bidder realizes that if his bid actually prevails , if the incumbent fails to match it , he almost certainly overbid . given this , most competitors will not even bother to bid in an auction when an incumbent has the right of first refusal , and those that submit a bid do not rationally invest the time , expense and expertise necessary ; they may just "" fire off "" a "" low - ball "" bid . after all , in almost every conceivable "" state of the world "" arising from the auction the competitors expect to lose money . so , the incumbent almost always retains the contract at a below - market price , despite the incumbent not necessarily placing the highest value on the contract because the incumbent cannot put the contract to its most efficient use .",0,auctions incumbent right first refusal shelley colleague clayton vernon background economics wrote short summary arguments rofr working second approach problem try come numerical estimate value option fact incumbent shipper option distributional consequences something value never paid numerical estimate value option could help argue value option case specific shall rather produce template use valuation case case vince kaminski forwarded vince j kaminski hou ect clayton vernon enron vince j kaminski hou ect ect cc stinson gibner hou ect ect zlu hou ect ect subject auctions incumbent right first refusal vince essay issue discussing adverse economic impact rights first refusal option first refuse match competitor offer restraint free trade impediment efficiency marketplace economic conclusion unambiguous incumbent right match offer made competitor item service value competitors invest time expense necessary prepare submit offers offers lower would otherwise contract often awarded inefficient incumbent instead efficient challenger traditional auction bids sealed item auction awarded highest bidder safely predict item awarded bidder values price reflecting full value item auction efficient result market economy financing high bid reflects resources freely allocated high bidder auction open bids safely predict item awarded correct bidder albeit slightly lower price donor item since bidder highest valuation simply increment infinitesimal amount second highest valuation modified auction incumbent bidder right match highest bid retain item competing bidder must justify due diligence bid preparation expenses following likely scenario incumbent spend due diligence instead uses savings help finance matching top bid competitor simply put incumbent right first refusal safely predicted simply match competitor bid rule thumb incumbent valuation item auction less valuation competitor amount due diligence administrative expenses incumbent firm expropriates expertise competitors valuations nontrivial financial exercise operational details required submitted along bid furthermore esoteric concept known winner curse bidder realizes bid actually prevails incumbent fails match almost certainly overbid given competitors even bother bid auction incumbent right first refusal submit bid rationally invest time expense expertise necessary may fire low ball bid almost every conceivable state world arising auction competitors expect lose money incumbent almost always retains contract market price despite incumbent necessarily placing highest value contract incumbent put contract efficient use

i ' m trying to rearrange my trip for a couple of week ' s time when my ear has cleared up , and i look forward to meeting with you one day . i wrote to vince last week asking for a favour , but i ' m not sure ifhe is there in houston . i know that you guys are probably very busy but i was wondering if you can write a few sentences for me . i ' m sending out some sample chapters to the people who responded positively ( all of them ! ) to my request for some feedback on the book . chapter 1 has an ' overview ' of the book with just a couple of sentences on each chapter . could you please write a sentence or two for your chapter ? i ' m including what i have already written ( although i think it has changed slightly from this version ) so that you can see the style . many thanks and best regards . chris . 2 overview of this book this book aims to provide an in - depth understanding of the pricing and risk management of energy derivatives . in the remainder of this chapter we give an overview of the fundamental principals needed to model and price energy assets , and which underlie the rest of the book . as well as introducing the techniques that underlie the black - scholes modelling framework we discuss the numerical techniques of trinomial trees and monte carlo simulation for derivative pricing which are used extensively later in the book . in chapter 2 we analyse spot energy prices . apart from describing empirical prices we propose a number of processes that can be used to model the prices . we look at the well - know process of gbm as well as mean reversion , stochastic volatility and jump processes , discussing each , and showing how they can be simulated and their parameters estimated . chapter 3 , written by vince kaminski , grant masson and ronnie chahal of enron corporation , discusses volatility estimation in energy commodity markets . this chapter builds on the previous one . it examines in detail the methods , merits and pitfalls of the volatility estimation process assuming different pricing models introduced in chapter 2 . examples from crude , gas , and electricity markets are used to illustrate the technical and interpretative aspects of calculating volatility . chapter 4 examines forward curves in the energy markets . although such curves are well understood and straight forward in the world debt markets the difficulty of storage in many energy markets leads to less well defined curves . what we do in this chapter chapter 5 presents an overview of the common and not - so - common derivative structures in the energy markets and discusses their uses . examples of products analysed in this chapter include a variety of swaps , caps , floors and collars , as well as energy swaptions , compound options , asian ( or average rate ) options , barriers , lookbacks , and ladder options . chapter 6 investigates single and multi - factor models of the energy spot price and the pricing of some standard energy derivatives . closed form solutions for forward prices , forward volatilities , and european option prices are derived and presented for all the models in this chapter including a three factor stochastic convenience yield and interest rate model with jumps . chapter 7 shows how the prices of path dependent and american style options can be evaluated for the models in chapter 6 . simulation schemes are developed for the evaluation of european style options and applied to a variety of path dependent options . in order to price options which incorporate early exercise opportunities , a trinomial tree scheme is developed . this tree is built to be consistent with the observed forward curve and can be used to price exotic as well as standard american style options . chapter 8 develops a new methodology for valuing energy options based on modelling the market observed forward curve . the approach results in a multi - factor model that is able to capture realistically the evolution of a wide range of energy forward curves and where the user defined volatility structures can be of an extremely general form . closed - form solutions are developed for pricing standard european options and efficient monte carlo schemes for exotic options . the chapter finishes with a discussion of the valuation of american style options . chapter 9 focuses on the risk management of energy derivative positions . in this chapter we discuss the management of price risk for institutions that sell options or other derivatives to a client and who is then faced with the problem of managing the risk through time . we begin with delta hedging a portfolio containing derivatives and look at extensions to gamma hedging - using the models from chapters 5 and 7 . the general model of chapter 7 ideally suited to multi - factor hedging and this is also discussed . chapter 10 looks at the key risk - management concept of value at risk applied to portfolios containing energy derivative portfolios . after discussing the concept of the measure , we look at how the key inputs ( volatilities , covariances , correlations , etc ) can be estimated . we then compare the fours major methodologies for computing var ; delta , delta - gamma , historical simulation and monte - carlo simulation . finally , we look at testing the var estimates for various underlying energy market variables .",0,energy book vl vince rewritten paragragh chapter please read return comments thanks grant forwarded grant masson hou ect pm chris strickland grant masson ect vkamins ect cc subject energy book hi grant hope well trust got message via voicemail ileft vince late friday afternoon inability travel trying rearrange trip couple week time ear cleared look forward meeting one day wrote vince last week asking favour sure ifhe houston know guys probably busy wondering write sentences sending sample chapters people responded positively request feedback book chapter overview book couple sentences chapter could please write sentence two chapter including already written although think changed slightly version see style many thanks best regards chris overview book book aims provide depth understanding pricing risk management energy derivatives remainder chapter give overview fundamental principals needed model price energy assets underlie rest book well introducing techniques underlie black scholes modelling framework discuss numerical techniques trinomial trees monte carlo simulation derivative pricing used extensively later book chapter analyse spot energy prices apart describing empirical prices propose number processes used model prices look well know process gbm well mean reversion stochastic volatility jump processes discussing showing simulated parameters estimated chapter written vince kaminski grant masson ronnie chahal enron corporation discusses volatility estimation energy commodity markets chapter builds previous one examines detail methods merits pitfalls volatility estimation process assuming different pricing models introduced chapter examples crude gas electricity markets used illustrate technical interpretative aspects calculating volatility chapter examines forward curves energy markets although curves well understood straight forward world debt markets difficulty storage many energy markets leads less well defined curves chapter chapter presents overview common common derivative structures energy markets discusses uses examples products analysed chapter include variety swaps caps floors collars well energy swaptions compound options asian average rate options barriers lookbacks ladder options chapter investigates single multi factor models energy spot price pricing standard energy derivatives closed form solutions forward prices forward volatilities european option prices derived presented models chapter including three factor stochastic convenience yield interest rate model jumps chapter shows prices path dependent american style options evaluated models chapter simulation schemes developed evaluation european style options applied variety path dependent options order price options incorporate early exercise opportunities trinomial tree scheme developed tree built consistent observed forward curve used price exotic well standard american style options chapter develops new methodology valuing energy options based modelling market observed forward curve approach results multi factor model able capture realistically evolution wide range energy forward curves user defined volatility structures extremely general form closed form solutions developed pricing standard european options efficient monte carlo schemes exotic options chapter finishes discussion valuation american style options chapter focuses risk management energy derivative positions chapter discuss management price risk institutions sell options derivatives client faced problem managing risk time begin delta hedging portfolio containing derivatives look extensions gamma hedging using models chapters general model chapter ideally suited multi factor hedging also discussed chapter looks key risk management concept value risk applied portfolios containing energy derivative portfolios discussing concept measure look key inputs volatilities covariances correlations etc estimated compare fours major methodologies computing var delta delta gamma historical simulation monte carlo simulation finally look testing var estimates various underlying energy market variables

. considering the relationship between sa and my country ' s new government , my mother advised me to leave for sa for security reason , while the funds were deposited with a security company abroad . on getting to there where i have been living since then as a political refugee i am seeking for a reliable foreigner who can assist me in moving this money out for safe banking and profitable investment . honestly i contacted you because i don ' t want to invest this money in here due to my status here as a political refugee . and moreover i wouldn ' t want to take risk because this money is all that i and my mother is depending on because my half brother has seized all my father ' s assets and money and left i and my mother empty handed without knowing about this funds deposited at the security company in abroad so that is why i decided that investing this money abroad should be the best investment for me . i will be honored if i can be given the privilege of investing this money with your help . in view of this plight , i expect you to be trustworthy and kind enough to respond to this distress call to save my mother and i from a hopeless future . and if you agree , i hereby agree to compensate your sincere and candid effort in this regard with 15 % of the total money and annual 5 % of the after tax returns on investment for the first three years . thereafter , the

"alliance info alert dear generation / power marketing executive : the following is this week ' s alliance express newsletter , and a special announcement regarding a proposed action by the financial accounting standards board ( fasb ) . fasb 133 fasb is considering an exception to statement of financial accounting standards ( sfas ) no . 133 that will exempt energy companies from the requirement to account for capacity contracts as derivatives . a vote against the exception would result in a significant increase in earnings volatility , and raises other important concerns for energy suppliers . ( attached is a summary of this issue . ) the board is expected to vote on this issue during may 2001 . eei will be taking steps to appraise fasb of our concerns . if you , or company cfo would like more information about this effort , please contact richard mcmahon , executive director of the alliance of energy suppliers , at rmcmahon @ eei . org , or at 202 - 508 - 5571 . alliance of energy suppliers express   april 25 , 2001 inside washington federal affairs * * * bill repealing puhca is approved by senate committee * * * the senate banking committee today approved s 206 , a bill that repeals the public utility holding company act of 1935 . the bill would repeal puhca and transfer oversight of public utility holding companies from the securities and exchange commission to the federal energy regulatory commission and appropriate state agencies . s . 206 was approved with two amendments . offered by sen . mike enzi ( r - wy ) , the first amendment would establish the electric energy market competition task force to study competition in the wholesale and retail market for electric energy in the united states . the task force would be made up of representatives of ferc , the department of justice and the federal trade commission , as well as non - voting representatives from the department of agriculture and the securities and exchange commission . the amendment also contained a provision , co - sponsored by sen . paul sarbanes ( d - md ) , that would preserve ferc ' s authority to require that energy rates are reasonable and do not include the pass - through of holding company costs that are unrelated to energy . another amendment , offered by sen . jon corzine ( d - nj ) , initiated a study by the general accounting office of the success of federal and state governments in preventing anticompetitive practices by public utility holding companies and in promoting competition and efficient energy markets . * * * institute   s tax agreement with public power again introduced on hill * * * the tax agreement eei reached with the american public power association ( appa ) and the large public power council ( lppc ) again has been introduced in the house . the bill ( hr 1459 ) contains the same provisions as were in a measure ( hr 4971 ) , with technical corrections , introduced during the 106 th congress . hr 1459 was introduced by rep . j . d . hayworth ( r - az ) and nine original co - sponsors from the ways and means committee . hr 1459 contains four key provisions with tax code changes : 1 ) the tax - free sale or spin - off of transmission assets into an rto is allowed , 2 ) nuclear decommissioning laws are adapted to a competitive market by allowing deductions to a trust fund no longer subject to cost - of service ratemaking , 3 ) the contributions in aid of construction ( ciac ) tax on interconnections to transmission and distribution facilities is eliminated , and 4 ) private use tax rules are changed to permit open access to transmission and distribution facilities . the measure was referred to the house ways and means committee , and eei has urged congress to act without delay in moving it forward . enactment will help encourage a vigorous but fair competitive environment , the institute noted . the same legislation has been incorporated into s 389 , senate energy committee chairman frank murkowski ' s ( r - ak ) energy security bill , and stand - alone legislation could also be introduced . hearings are expected to be held in both the senate finance and house ways and means committees , probably after consideration of president bush ' s individual tax proposal . administration / ferc * * * white house seeks $ 2 trillion budget in fiscal year 2002 * * * president bush last week transmitted a $ 2 trillion fiscal year 2002 budget request to capitol hill . the administration noted that its proposal * moderates recent explosive growth in discretionary spending to four percent in 2002 , * an increase of $ 26 billion over the preceding fiscal year . the budget bid contains a $ 231 billion total surplus in 2002 , and projects a $ 5 . 6 trillion surplus over the next ten years . in the energy area , the administration noted the federal government   s * longstanding and evolving role * in the sector , pointing out that most federal energy programs and agencies have no state or private counterparts . it proposed about $ 2 . 8 billion in discretionary spending for energy programs , and about $ 2 . 1 billion in tax benefits , * mainly to encourage development of traditional and alternative energy sources . * doe   s budget request was $ 19 . 2 billion , including $ 2 . 3 billion for energy resources programs . this later figure represents a decrease of $ 196 million , or 7 . 9 percent , from fiscal year 2001 . in the environmental sector , the administration sought some $ 7 . 3 billion in discretionary funding for epa , including a $ 3 . 7 billion operating program focused on implementation of most federal pollution control laws . * * * success of restructuring tied to energy strategy , ferc   s massey asserts * * * electric restructuring may be in jeopardy , and its success * is in the hands of regulators and policymakers , * ferc commissioner william massey has asserted . speaking at a recent national governors association policy forum in philadelphia , commissioner massey urged officials to pay attention to the key elements of a national energy strategy . first , he specified , there is a need for an adequate supply of the energy commodity . turning to a second element , commissioner massey told forum attendees that * all the supply in the world won   t help unless it can be delivered over an adequate , efficient , non - discriminatory network . * commissioner massey identified market structure as the third essential element of a national energy strategy , while citing an inherent difficulty : that * good structure cannot be easily parsed between wholesale and retail jurisdictions . * accordingly , he said , ferc and the states must work together on market structure . the final element of a successful energy strategy , the commissioner specified , is the need for aggressive ferc intervention when markets fail to do their job . * if the states cannot depend on the wholesale market regulator to ensure reasonable prices for consumers , * he cautioned , they * will surely think twice before heading down the restructuring path . * new generation * * * dynegy to build second plant in kentucky * * * dynegy has announced plans to construct a new 330 megawatt plant adjacent to the riverside generating project in lawrence county , kentucky . dynegy will sell the power generated at the plant in the wholesale market . commercial operation is expected to begin first quarter of 2002 . * * * ppl to expand generation capacity * * * ppl corporation this week said it would build a 540 megawatt power plant near chicago and would increase the capacity of its susquehanna nuclear plant by 100 megawatts . ceo william hecht said the illinois plant is expected to be in service by the summer of 2002 . * * * constellation energy group announces eight new plants * * * constellation energy group this week announced that the company is scheduled to bring four peaking power plants on line this summer . additionally , four larger power plants are scheduled to enter service in the following two summers . the four peaking plants are located in illinois , pennsylvania , virginia and west virginia . the larger power plants are under construction in california , florida , illinois , and texas . * we   re building in these seven states because they serve regions where wholesale electricity is needed and where we can provide energy to support our national power marketing business , * said constellation energy group chairman and ceo christian poindexter . * * * california energy commission approves construction of otay mesa generating plant * * * pg & e corporation   s national energy group ( neg ) last week announced that the california energy commission ( cec ) has approved construction of the otay mesa generating plant in san diego county , which the neg has developed . the 500 megawatt project will produce enough electricity to power about 1 , 000 homes . after the development process is completed , calpine corporation will assume ownership of the project and will construct and operate the plant . neg will contract for up to half the plants output . energy data * * * weekly electric output ( week 15 ) * * * electric output reached 63 , 528 gwh for the week ending april 14 ( week 15 ) , with the highest increase over 2000 levels in the south central states , which both had a 12 . 6 percent increase over 2000 for week 15 . year - to - date , the rocky mountain region experienced the greatest increase in output ( 7 . 6 percent ) over 2000 . for more information ,

"re : generation earnings model michelle , i agree with you that we need to run at least 500 iterations . but i did not realize that it took 16 hours to run 100 iterations . helen and i talked earlier about using parallel computing technique to split the algorithm into smaller parts and run the parts separately on different processors , then aggregate the results . this procedure makes better use of computer power and saves time . looks like we have to do it this way now . buying a more powerful computer helps but does not solve the problem . in addition , we might want to re - consider if writing the code in vb is optimal . i was assured at the very beginning that vb runs as fast ( if not faster ) as c , but some re - assurance from it group on this issue is helpful . best , alex from : michelle d cisneros @ ect 04 / 09 / 2001 02 : 52 pm to : alex huang / corp / enron @ enron cc : gary hickerson , danielle romain subject : generation earnings model hi alex - danielle and i were talking to david m . today regarding running the model for purposes of back testing the results . last week we ran calpine using 46 days of historical forward price data at 10 and 100 iterations . the 100 iteration run took 16 hours to run . to run all 20 companies with the 46 days worth of data and at 100 iterations is estimated to take about 28 days . we are concerned that 100 iterations will not be sufficient and will need to be increased to at least 500 iterations . we are thinking that we need to use a server or something much more powerful than the test computer we have been using . do you have any suggestions as to how we can improve the process ? thanks , michelle x 35435 hi alex - danielle and i were talking to david m . today regarding running the model for purposes of back testing the results . last week we ran calpine using 46 days of historical forward price data at 10 and 100 iterations . the 100 iteration run took 16 hours to run . to run all 20 companies with the 46 days worth of data and at 100 iterations is estimated to take about 28 days . we are concerned that 100 iterations will not be sufficient and will need to be increased to at least 500 iterations . we are thinking that we need to use a server or something much more powerful than the test computer we have been using . do you have any suggestions as to how we can improve the process ? thanks , michelle x 35435",0,generation earnings model michelle agree need run least iterations realize took hours run iterations helen talked earlier using parallel computing technique split algorithm smaller parts run parts separately different processors aggregate results procedure makes better use computer power saves time looks like way buying powerful computer helps solve problem addition might want consider writing code vb optimal assured beginning vb runs fast faster c assurance group issue helpful best alex michelle cisneros ect pm alex huang corp enron enron cc gary hickerson danielle romain subject generation earnings model hi alex danielle talking david today regarding running model purposes back testing results last week ran calpine using days historical forward price data iterations iteration run took hours run run companies days worth data iterations estimated take days concerned iterations sufficient need increased least iterations thinking need use server something much powerful test computer using suggestions improve process thanks michelle x hi alex danielle talking david today regarding running model purposes back testing results last week ran calpine using days historical forward price data iterations iteration run took hours run run companies days worth data iterations estimated take days concerned iterations sufficient need increased least iterations thinking need use server something much powerful test computer using suggestions improve process thanks michelle x

"re : energy derivatives hi vince , hope all is well with you . i ' m looking forward to seeing you again next week and meeting with grant . can you guys do me favour ? i ' m sending out some sample chapters to the people who responded positively ( all of them ! ) to my request for some feedback on the book . chapter 1 has an ' overview ' of the book with just a couple of sentences on each chapter . could you please write a sentence or two for your chapter ? i ' m including what i have already written so that you can see the style . many thanks and best regards . chris . 2 overview of this book this book aims to provide an in - depth understanding of the pricing and risk management of energy derivatives . in the remainder of this chapter we give an overview of the fundamental principals needed to model and price energy assets , and which underlie the rest of the book . as well as introducing the techniques that underlie the black - scholes modelling framework we discuss the numerical techniques of trinomial trees and monte carlo simulation for derivative pricing which are used extensively later in the book . in chapter 2 we analyse spot energy prices . apart from describing empirical prices we propose a number of processes that can be used to model the prices . we look at the well - know process of gbm as well as mean reversion , stochastic volatility and jump processes , discussing each , and showing how they can be simulated and their parameters estimated . chapter 3 , written by vince kaminski and grant masson of enron capital and trade . chapter 4 examines forward curves in the energy markets . although such curves are well understood and straight forward in the world debt markets the difficulty of storage in many energy markets leads to less well defined curves . what we do in this chapter chapter 5 presents an overview of the common and not - so - common derivative structures in the energy markets and discusses their uses . examples of products analysed in this chapter include a variety of swaps , caps , floors and collars , as well as energy swaptions , compound options , asian ( or average rate ) options , barriers , lookbacks , and ladder options . chapter 6 investigates single and multi - factor models of the energy spot price and the pricing of some standard energy derivatives . closed form solutions for forward prices , forward volatilities , and european option prices are derived and presented for all the models in this chapter including a three factor stochastic convenience yield and interest rate model with jumps . chapter 7 shows how the prices of path dependent and american style options can be evaluated for the models in chapter 6 . simulation schemes are developed for the evaluation of european style options and applied to a variety of path dependent options . in order to price options which incorporate early exercise opportunities , a trinomial tree scheme is developed . this tree is built to be consistent with the observed forward curve and can be used to price exotic as well as standard american style options . chapter 8 develops a new methodology for valuing energy options based on modelling the market observed forward curve . the approach results in a multi - factor model that is able to capture realistically the evolution of a wide range of energy forward curves and where the user defined volatility structures can be of an extremely general form . closed - form solutions are developed for pricing standard european options and efficient monte carlo schemes for exotic options . the chapter finishes with a discussion of the valuation of american style options . chapter 9 focuses on the risk management of energy derivative positions . in this chapter we discuss the management of price risk for institutions that sell options or other derivatives to a client and who is then faced with the problem of managing the risk through time . we begin with delta hedging a portfolio containing derivatives and look at extensions to gamma hedging - using the models from chapters 5 and 7 . the general model of chapter 7 ideally suited to multi - factor hedging and this is also discussed . chapter 10 looks at the key risk - management concept of value at risk applied to portfolios containing energy derivative portfolios . after discussing the concept of the measure , we look at how the key inputs ( volatilities , covariances , correlations , etc ) can be estimated . we then compare the fours major methodologies for computing var ; delta , delta - gamma , historical simulation and monte - carlo simulation . finally , we look at testing the var estimates for various underlying energy market variables . finally , we finish with credit risk in energy markets in chapter 11 .",0,energy derivatives hi vince hope well looking forward seeing next week meeting grant guys favour sending sample chapters people responded positively request feedback book chapter overview book couple sentences chapter could please write sentence two chapter including already written see style many thanks best regards chris overview book book aims provide depth understanding pricing risk management energy derivatives remainder chapter give overview fundamental principals needed model price energy assets underlie rest book well introducing techniques underlie black scholes modelling framework discuss numerical techniques trinomial trees monte carlo simulation derivative pricing used extensively later book chapter analyse spot energy prices apart describing empirical prices propose number processes used model prices look well know process gbm well mean reversion stochastic volatility jump processes discussing showing simulated parameters estimated chapter written vince kaminski grant masson enron capital trade chapter examines forward curves energy markets although curves well understood straight forward world debt markets difficulty storage many energy markets leads less well defined curves chapter chapter presents overview common common derivative structures energy markets discusses uses examples products analysed chapter include variety swaps caps floors collars well energy swaptions compound options asian average rate options barriers lookbacks ladder options chapter investigates single multi factor models energy spot price pricing standard energy derivatives closed form solutions forward prices forward volatilities european option prices derived presented models chapter including three factor stochastic convenience yield interest rate model jumps chapter shows prices path dependent american style options evaluated models chapter simulation schemes developed evaluation european style options applied variety path dependent options order price options incorporate early exercise opportunities trinomial tree scheme developed tree built consistent observed forward curve used price exotic well standard american style options chapter develops new methodology valuing energy options based modelling market observed forward curve approach results multi factor model able capture realistically evolution wide range energy forward curves user defined volatility structures extremely general form closed form solutions developed pricing standard european options efficient monte carlo schemes exotic options chapter finishes discussion valuation american style options chapter focuses risk management energy derivative positions chapter discuss management price risk institutions sell options derivatives client faced problem managing risk time begin delta hedging portfolio containing derivatives look extensions gamma hedging using models chapters general model chapter ideally suited multi factor hedging also discussed chapter looks key risk management concept value risk applied portfolios containing energy derivative portfolios discussing concept measure look key inputs volatilities covariances correlations etc estimated compare fours major methodologies computing var delta delta gamma historical simulation monte carlo simulation finally look testing var estimates various underlying energy market variables finally finish credit risk energy markets chapter

( gtts ) be the next stock to rock ? recently , we read an article in the economist that highlighted online gaming and how it has become a socially acceptable form of entertainment . over the next few days , as we thought about what sort of impact this trend could have , we started to notice that online gambling was being discussed all over the media - in newspapers , online and on television . it became obvious to us that more and more people were jumping on the internet to bet on games . we also came across some staggering statistics . merrill lynch , for example , has predicted that gambling has the potential to account for a full 1 % of global economic activity ! another source , ecommercetimes . com , recently reported that the scope of this business is so enormous that some have even claimed that it is the single most important factor in the growth of e - commerce . the online gaming industry , in other words , appears to be booming , and it may be an ideal time to is time to invest . we decided to find out who the key players were in the business . after speaking with a number of industry insiders , the trail led us to an emerging , publicly traded company called gaming transactions inc . ( ggts ) . after a close look at ggts , we decided that this company could produce huge returns on investment in the upcoming months . although ggts is a new company , it has some surprisingly experienced players at the helm an uncommon thing to find in an industry only ten years old . the company has come out with online versions of the addictive game keno . and its management team was smart enough to secure the rights to the keno . com website , which , if youre marketing keno , is as good as it gets . keno has the widest spread for the house of any mainstream gambling game . ggts is also about to launch a suite of other online gambling games , including poker and sports - book betting . once it offers these popular games , and given that it already has keno . com online , the company could bring in great revenues , attracting a lot of attention in the investment community and driving up its stock price . after a successful north american launch , gaming transactions inc . ( gtts ) has translated its games into chinese and is about to hit asia . this initiative looks like a wise business decision : many analysis anticipate that china will be the biggest source of online gambling revenue by 2007 , so the company could be poised for massive expansion in terms of both profits and global reach . what does all this tell us ? a brand new company , a popular , well - known game , one of the biggest spreads for the house , a growing market , experienced management , and a stock price that is trading under a dollar it adds up to the potential for huge gains for early investors . if youre interested in more information on the market and gaming transactions inc . , click here to read a free ten - page report . . . to join market movers mailings http : / / ggtsstock . com to find out more . first source data inc . 4535 west sahara ave # 217 las vegas nevada 89102 disclosure and disclaimer investment news indepth reports ( hereinafter inir ) , operated by first source data , inc .

"wall street ' s dirty little secret . . . it was the spring of 1979 . i was just a tall , goofy looking kid in middle school with buck - teeth and freckles . each day in the cafeteria , i walked from table to table . . . stealing other kids ' lunch money . no , i didn ' t rob them with a gun or a knife - i just made them a little deal . "" let me borrow two dollars today , "" i said , "" and i ' ll bring you five dollars next week . "" the investment was too good to pass up , and other kids were throwing their lunch money at me like gravy on mashed potatoes . of course when "" next week "" rolled around and i couldn ' t pony up the cash , i promised to pay them even more the week after that , if they would just let me keep their investment a little bit longer . eventually the end of the year came and went , high school started and with it came girls , and homework , and parties , and sports , and those poor kids from eighth grade had more things on their mind than last year ' s lunch money . i made off with a tidy sum for a middle school kid , and i didn ' t even get beat up . hidden inside this story are the two greatest stock market secrets you will ever learn . first of all , greed is your number one enemy . you ' re not going to turn $ 2 into $ 5 in a week , so cash out when you ' re ahead . don ' t wait for the boat to sink before grabbing the lifejacket . second , never trust an investment adviser of any kind . they are looking out for their own money , not yours . the "" professionals "" , those stuffy investment counselors and money managers , will always tell you that the best time to buy is now . according to those guys , the longer you keep your money in the market , the more money you ' re going to make . ask them when is the best time to sell and their answer is "" never "" . in a sense , they are right . if you put $ 250 , 000 in an index fund right now , you ' ll probably have over a million dollars in thirty or forty years . but here ' s the problem : do you want to wait thirty or forty years to be rich ? hell no ! you want the money now - so you can enjoy it . it ' s hard to make use of your fortune when you ' re seventy years old in a wheelchair . if you could make a million dollars in the next few years , what would you do with it ? where would you travel ? what kind of car would you buy ? the fact is . . . youth is the best time to be rich . if your goal is to make quick profits in the market , volatility is your ally , and stability your enemy . you want to see those large upswings , two hundred points in a day , followed by the four hundred point crash a week later . you don ' t care if the market went up or down 20 % this year as long it was unstable . that ' s how you ' re going to make the money . what i ' m talking about here is day trading . my father invests the traditional way ; he holds some good stocks and he goes up 30 k and down 30 k . in the long term of 5 - 10 years he makes money . the day trader buys or sells 5 , 000 shares of xyz for a $ 25 , 000 profit in a 5 - 10 minute trade . he acts quickly , taking advantage of all the information at his disposal about a certain stock , and estimating whether it will go up or down within hours , sometimes within minutes . i can teach you how to do this - and how to make amazing amounts of money at it . it ' s not rocket science , and you only need to learn a few basic principles to get started . society would have you believe that successful trading is complicated and requires formal training . the truth is , wealthy people use very simple investment strategies to make money . popular media and investment professionals portray successful trading as difficult and complex to scare you out of the boxing ring . they don ' t want the competetion - and they sure as hell don ' t want you paying a few dollars to an online trading firm to execute a trade for which they ' d charge you forty or fifty dollars . they make their money only if you believe two lies : 1 ) that investing is too difficult and risky for the average person . 2 ) that using an investment adviser who charges a high commission is safer than trading online for a few bucks per trade . here is what the financial gurus in today ' s society absolutely , positively do not want you to know . . . the strategies for profitable day trading are in fact so simple that anyone can do it - provided they spend a few hours of studying . after reading over 200 financial books and publications during the past decade , and after using day trading to successfully make more than four million dollars in the stock market , i ' ve learned the following lessons : * * achieving financial success is incredibly simple . * * anyone can do it . * * it only takes a few hours to learn . when i discovered the secret to day trading , i didn ' t become wealthy overnight . if you want instant cash , drive to wal - mart . buy a ski mask and a shotgun , and rob your local bank . the only way to get rich , quick or otherwise , is through hard work , knowledge , and determination . after learning the fundamentals of day trading , i started practicing the trading art itself , and the first few weeks brought modest gains . the next few months gave me the practical experience i needed to really earn a living , and i was pulling close to a six figure income . in less than three years with no formal financial training , minimal effort and only moderate risk , i had made my first million . the knowledge that i gained during those formative trading years i am willing to share with you in my new book , the master trader . you will learn from my mistakes , and from my successes , as i teach you the simple , secret formula for day trading that i ' ve used profitably year after year . the income of the day trader can be staggering . thousands , even hundreds of thousands of dollars can be made or lost within minutes . the difference between making money and losing your shirt is simply this : knowledge . i will provide that knowledge , and i will give you a winning edge at this high - stakes game . average income of a day trader : 5 % average an income in excess of $ 500 , 000 per year 22 % average an income in excess of $ 250 , 000 per year 35 % average an income in excess of $ 100 , 000 per year . 27 % average an income between $ 50 , 000 and $ 99 , 999 per year 11 % average an income between $ 20 , 000 and $ 49 , 999 per year after reading the master trader , you will discover extremely profitable , simple yet powerful trading methods that give you an almost unfair trading advantage and make you win despite the current market weakness . here is just a snippet of what i will teach you : * * * make money whether a stock goes up or down . * * * learn how to get in and out of stocks within split seconds . * * * learn exactly what stocks to trade , the exact price to buy them and the exact price to sell them . * * * save thousands of dollars by learning to avoid the mistakes beginners make . * * * learn how to trade stocks like a pro and how to make money consistently in every market ! * * * learn proven strategies that give you the highest chance for great success . * * * profit on huge intraday price swings . * * * make money on the biggest news stories . * * * actively manage your risks and learn how to realize maximum returns . * * * learn how to use the tools and information wall street professionals use . * * * learn how to develop and maintain a winning state of mind . it ' s time to ask yourself : "" am i going to listen to the professionals who say buy buy buy but never sell ? or am i going to take control of my own financial future , and start making money right now in the stock market ? "" who is looking out for your best economic interests - some wealthy wall street stockbroker , or yourself ? with the master trader e - book , you will learn everything you need to know in order to

friends laughed when he said he was going to make money in the stock market . six years later , he bought a beach - front home on the california coast - with cash . oops , they weren ' t laughing anymore . in a rollercoaster market like we have today , day trading is the fastest track to wealth . if you ' re looking for a long - term retirement investment with no risk that goes up 5 % a year ,

"re : lng may 19 decision john , sorry for the confusion . this is a second tanker on which very few details are available . the lng group is working as we speak to provide some information for joe sutton before his departure for paris this ( tuesday ) afternoon . there is no dash on this 2 nd tanker yet . i asked dave gorte on monday to send me one and was not told that he can provide me with the mystic lady dash as the closest substitute . vince john sherriff 05 / 16 / 2000 12 : 20 am to : vince j kaminski / hou / ect @ ect cc : subject : re : lng may 19 decision vince - thanks for the update . what i am not sure of is what if any decision has to be made on may 19 . it seems to me that the mystic lady and elba island deals have already been approved and executed - but it is quite likely i am missing a detail or two . john vince j kaminski 15 / 05 / 2000 17 : 14 to : john sherriff / lon / ect @ ect cc : vince j kaminski / hou / ect @ ect , david gorte / hou / ect @ ect , rick buy / hou / ect @ ect , ted murphy / hou / ect @ ect subject : re : lng may 19 decision john , this is the update on what i have done for the lng transactions . 1 . i was not involved in the lng ship project . i shall read the dash and give you my comments . without looking at the details , i think that the decision to charter a tanker removes one significant risk we have at the elba island project ( please , see point 2 ) . 2 . elba island . i am working with doug rotenberbg , brad hitch , scott earnest ( sally beck ' s organization ) and rac to set up the book for the elba island transaction . the next step will be to expand the book to capture all the enron ' s lng - related positions in one place and to look for natural risk offsets and possible hedges . a working group is meeting to close a few remaining gaps tomorrow ( tuesday ) at 8 : 30 . a few comments on the book design and my view of the project : a . the current thinking is that lng will be sourced for the elba island facility by buying marginal cargos on the fob basis . marginal cargos will represent supply from excess capacity that has not been committed under long - term contracts or became available due to some short - term frictions . the fob cargos are typically selling at a significant discount to the long - term contract prices . the economics of the deal , as represented by the book we are setting up , will reflect the assumption that not only we can locate marginal cargos but that we shall be able to do it on a regular basis , arranging shipping and coordinating the facility schedule and natural gas transactions in the us . in other words , we have a significant logistical and operational risk in this transaction . b . the transaction will cover the period of 17 years ( with an extension option of 5 years ) . even if we can lock - in the lng volumes over this time period , we have no ability to lock - in the other side of the spread ( us gas prices ) for such a long tenor . this is essentially a tolling transaction with exposure to the lng - nat gas spread and i would not recommend locking - in only one leg of the spread . one solution would be to cover , let ' s say , 50 % of he lng volumes for the first 5 years and lock - in the nat gas side on the us market side . c . the book we are setting up will be based on many managerial assumptions regarding sources of lng , shipping rates , schedules , etc . i would set up a big prudence reserve in case we mark it to market . d . my group will work on valuation of some options we have in the elba island deal ( that are good for enron ) and on the hedging strategy for the lng positions . long - term lng contracts are typically based on the japanese crude cocktail that correlates very well with brent . vince john sherriff 05 / 14 / 2000 01 : 40 am to : vince j kaminski / hou / ect @ ect cc : lauren urquhart / lon / ect @ ect subject : lng may 19 decision vince i haven ' t spoken to you for awhile but hope the world is treating you well . anyway with greg moving to his new role i have ( i hope only temporarily ) staff trading oversight for the eastern hemishere plus lng . i understand that your group is taking a first cut at developing curves for lng and lng ship values . i also understand that another lng ship decision is on the dockets for may 19 ( not very far away ) . anway i understand this is a big decision but i still have gotten very little info yet . can you please let me know where you stand now ?

( c ) how enron manages the various books that involve physicals , financials , credit etc . this is specially important when many of the real assets have options features and therefore , include non - linear risk profiles . the story of gas is pretty well understood but not many of the others markets enron has been moving into over the last few years . on the gmii front , i think that some interesting opportunities arise when you think of the spectrum in a way similar to that of dark fiber . i am working with several people at lucent on this issue . i think it would be wonderful to engage in a conversation with enron and lucent folks in the room . i can do a lunch time talk on any of these issues . perhaps we can discuss some of these over a conference call . clearly , having vince kaminski in the room would be very important to me . as for schedules , the first 3 weeks of april are horrible . april 26 / 27 , may 3 / 4 are good for me . regards nalin at 06 : 56 pm 03 / 22 / 2001 , mack , iris wrote : > hi , > > as we briefly discussed , i spoke with one of my colleagues ( dr . > martin lin ) about your visiting enron to give a talk and to spend some > time with us to discuss you work in telecommunications , real options , > etc . > > martin and i are working on various broadband related problems . > > we thought it might be helpful if you let us know a bit more about > the following : > * when you want to come ( the research group has weekly > catered lunch on thursday and brown bag lunches on every other friday ) . > > * a description of what you want to talk about with respect > to telecoms , broadband , etc . > * who you would like to meet with me - vince kaminski ( our > boss ) , any other of our colleagues in research , broadband , etc . > . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . etc . > > > > > look forward to hearing from you . > > regards , > iris",0,fw possible visit enron professor nalin kulatilaka boston university iris wrote endorsement book real options cover jeff skilling name let invite thursday lunch vince iris mack enron enronxgate pm stinson gibner hou ect ect stinson gibner enron communications cc vince j kaminski hou ect ect subject fw possible visit enron professor nalin kulatilaka boston university hi stinson colleague mine professor nalin kulatilaka boston university interested visiting enron give talk work broadband area please see forwarded emails information available dates let know give forum one thursday research lunches friday brown bag lunch thanks iris original message nalin kulatilaka enron com sent thursday march pm mack iris cc lin martin subject possible visit enron professor nalin kulatilaka boston university hi iris two different hats wear talking enron one financial economist director newly formed global mobility innovation initiative gmii research project funded lucent involving bu lbs insead study various aspects mobile internet read g former working couple ph students understanding details physical supply inventory used market maker problem studies context specialists inventory stock market think really interesting way enron newer markets like bandwidth think big issue lighting dark fiber ground b enron disciplining internal decision making process market many ways critical aspect real options finance people miss options one thing exercising realizing value another incomplete contracting asymmetric information incentive issues ignored real options valuation models real practice impression enron real success putting place organization able mitigate problems imposing market disciplining c enron manages various books involve physicals financials credit etc specially important many real assets options features therefore include non linear risk profiles story gas pretty well understood many others markets enron moving last years gmii front think interesting opportunities arise think spectrum way similar dark fiber working several people lucent issue think would wonderful engage conversation enron lucent folks room lunch time talk issues perhaps discuss conference call clearly vince kaminski room would important schedules first weeks april horrible april may good regards nalin pm mack iris wrote hi briefly discussed spoke one colleagues dr martin lin visiting enron give talk spend time us discuss work telecommunications real options etc martin working various broadband related problems thought might helpful let us know bit following want come research group weekly catered lunch thursday brown bag lunches every friday description want talk respect telecoms broadband etc would like meet vince kaminski boss colleagues research broadband etc etc look forward hearing regards iris

"" , i have to blush & say . . . persistence and personality . of course , i always follow the advice with my own little disclaimer : what makes me successful may not work the same for you . . . & your first lesson is to get over the deep - seeded idea that success - of any kind , in my opinion - is somehow an unknown , unattainable secret . clearly , it is not . it ' s not unknown . it ' s not unattainable . it ' s not years of digging to find the "" secrets "" to internet riches . one thing that "" gets to me "" so often in my work as an internet consultant , author and internet success strategist is that so many people on the net seem to have this incredibly huge mental block that stands between themselves and success on the net . it ' s almost as if they ' ve been barraged by so many claims of what works and what doesn ' t work , and so many long , complicated routes to actually succeeding in their online venture , that "" success "" is the equivelant of a 100 - foot high brick wall . it ' s not that difficult , my friends ! it is not that complicated ! ! long - time friend and business associate rick beneteau has a new ebook out called branding you & breaking the bank . get it ! ! http : / / www . roibot . com / bybb . cgi ?

it doesn ' t exist . there ' s nothing there to fear to begin with . . . get over it ! ! what i ' m telling you is , the only thing standing between you and the success you most desire . . . is yourself . when you realize this , you will tear down that brick wall by means of complete and instantaneous disintegration . it will no longer exist * in your mind * , which is the only "" real "" place it ever was anyhow ! yes , "" persistence and personality "" inherently includes honesty , integrity , accountability , and many other qualities but you also have to hone in on your ultimate goals and realize that probably the most valuable , powerful key to your success . . . is you ! that may be the most incredible "" secret "" we ever uncover in our lifetime ! and , trust me , that brick wall won ' t ever get in your way again . . . unless you let it . talk about simple ! ! bryan is a "" veteran "" internet consultant , author , internet success strategist & marketer . he publishes mega - success . com chronicles to over 11 , 500 subscribing members , authors articles which appear all over the net , and helps hundreds of wealth - hungry people in their journey to internet success . bryan is also director of his no bs guerrilla internet marketing group at http : / / . com & a fantastic new joint venture partners program for that site . bryan hall is a founding member and the development consultant for the prestigious icop ( tm ) at http : / / www . i - cop . org / 1016 . htm you can reach bryan at 877 . 230 . 3267 or by emailing him directly at bryan . hall @ mega - success . com = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = member showcase = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = examine carefully - those with email addresses included will trade links with you . . . you are encouraged to contact them . there are many ways to build a successful business - just look at these successful sites programs other members are involved in . . . get insane amounts of traffic to your website . purchase 10 , 000 guaranteed visitors to your site and receive 5 , 000 free . more traffic = more money ! less than 2 cents a visitor . space is limited . order now ! http : / / www . freepicklotto . com trade links - businessopps @ aol . com stop smoking - free lesson ! ! discover the secret to stopping smoking . to master these powerful techniques , come to http : / / www . breath - of - life . net for your free lesson . act now ! p . s . tell someone you care about . trade links - jturco 3 @ hotmail . com celebration sale ! $ 99 . 00 on casinos / sportsbetting sites , lingerie stores , gift stores , adult sites toy stores . mention ad # bmlm 99 to receive this special sale price . order now ! http : / / www . cyberopps . com / ?

"re : hello from vince kaminski at enron vince , thank you for forwarding the following messages . i am sorry that i am just now getting back to you , my lotus notes was down all afternoon yesterday . we currently have the cal berkeley general presentation set for wednesday , october 18 th at 7 : 00 p . m . which works out well because it is just prior to the time deadline for students to submit their resumes . the general presentation is a general overview of enron , the program , the interview process , as well as a chance for students to meet and chat with enron reps . since this is the first year that we are recruiting from cal berkeley , i think that it is important that i attend this event on campus so that i can answer any interview process questions . i will check the schedule and see if it is possible to move the presentation to the 23 rd . the only negative is that i will not be able to attend because i will be conducting interviews at rice that day . also , it is very difficult to find a location to hold the presentation , and i need to check on location availability on the 23 rd . however , i do think that we should take advantage of the seminar on campus . this may mean that they are two seperate trips to campus . perhaps , we can also set up some other presentations for the 23 rd or even the monday prior . although i would like to be able to attend the class / seminar presentations , i don ' t think that it is as vital as the general presentation . what are your thoughts ?

steve : i ' ll see if i can get in on the 25 th . . . will let you know , but i think it ' ll work . just to give you a very brief overview so you can think about who might be interested , abacus has the largest transactional database of consumer buying behavior in the world ( 89 million us households , 3 billion + purchases ) , along with sophisticated modeling capabilities to help predict customer response to various offers at the household level . given the critical need to reduce customer acquisition costs in retail energy markets , we believe that our data and modeling can help energy retailers target their direct marketing efforts toward the residential customers most likely to respond to whatever the offer is - - improving the efficiency of mailings and other promotional campaigns ( so there is an efficiency angle , see ! ) because our data allow the modeling of future buying behavior based on actual purchases , our results tend to be significantly more predictive than demographic - based models . so far , the the response from utilities and "" new entrants "" i ' ve been talking to so far has been quite positive , and we have some tests of our data underway , but we ' re interested in talking to as many players in the market as possible as we develop specific products to meet utility needs . i can provide more background if desired to whoever might be interested , but i guess the key immediate question is whether it might be worthwhile to arrange a short meeting sometime on the 25 th of april with whoever at enron might have interest in hearing what we ' re up to , and ( most importantly ) listening to what your data needs might be as you enter new markets . thanks very much for any help . . . i look forward to catching up and hearing how things are going for you . regards , brad davids 303 - 410 - 5531 - - - - - original message - - - - - from : steven . r . meyers @ enron . com [ mailto : steven . r . meyers @ enron . com ] sent : monday , april 10 , 2000 12 : 13 pm to : brad . davids @ abacus - direct . com subject : re : possible meeting ?

"extending eu gas guidelines to central and eastern europe - cera insight title : extending eu gas guidelines to central and eastern europe url : http : / / www 20 . cera . com / eprofile ? u = 35 & m = 2184 overview : a comprehensive reform of gas legislation in central and eastern europe is bringing the region in line with the european union  , s gas directive . this is true both for the countries expected to enter the union by 2004  ) 05  * czech republic , estonia , hungary , poland , and slovenia - - and for candidates whose entry is not scheduled before the end of the decade - - bulgaria , latvia , lithuania , romania , and slovakia . in cera  , s view current developments regarding the establishment of a legal framework for the internal gas market in eastern and central europe look promising from an investor  , s point of view . the candidate countries presented a review of progress made in the implementation of the eu gas directive during a two - day workshop held by the european commission and the world bank in paris in november . many of these countries have been reforming their energy industries throughout the 1990 s as part of their transition to a market economy . the results have been mixed , particularly in the utility industries . the 1998 gas directive ( adopted in august 2000 ) now offers a compelling incentive for eu candidate countries to transform their gas industries , while providing a road map to guide them . the critical points relevant to harmonization between the european union and candidate countries include the following : * legal framework and regulation . the legal framework is the cornerstone of enlargement and the yardstick of harmonization in europe . as a result , in all candidate countries in 1999  ) 2000 energy laws were either updated or newly established along the principles spelled out in the gas directive . regulatory bodies have been created by law and are operating in every country , although issues of staffing , financial autonomy , and independence from political influence are not uniformly resolved . * third - party access ( tpa ) and long - term take - or - pay contracts . all candidate countries agree that tpa is a key to market competition . therefore , all have adopted it or intend to do so in their new legislation . although the commission favors regulated tpa , the specific approaches to tpa enforcement in the candidate countries remain unclear in some cases . in particular , the implementation of tpa will have to address the issue of long - term take - or - pay contracts with russia that were signed by all major domestic gas companies and somewhat preempt competition . russian gas is for the most part sold to single , traditional state - owned operators that dominate their internal markets . a balance will need to be struck between these incumbent dominant players and the competitive environment . this is made more complicated by their ownership of large volumes of russian gas supplied in kind in exchange for transit rights to west european customers . article 25 of the directive provides for ! a derogation to companies experiencing difficulties stemming from take - or - pay obligations . this derogation would apply to the companies of candidate countries with historical and commercial links with the russian gas industry . furthermore , article 26 allows derogations to those member states with only one major gas supplier , to those with an  +  + emerging gas market status ,  ,  , or to those without a direct gas connection to the grid of another member state . most of the candidate countries would in principle be able to call on one or more of these grounds for derogation when they join the european union . * price cross - subsidies . residential gas tariffs are artificially low and are financed partially through higher rates applied to industrial consumers . in various countries , tariff increases and the phasing out of subsidies have been scheduled , but such decisions remain politically sensitive to enforce . this has recently been emphasized by high gas prices owing to the linkage of imported gas to oil prices . all candidate countries have set legal frameworks that include the phasing out of cross - subsidies as part of sector reform , but the actual implementation will remain politically difficult . as table 1 indicates , price rebalancing is already under way in most countries expected to enter the european union by mid - decade , but the legal framework itself cannot guarantee the pace of reform . the same goes for candidate countries that have only recently introduced eu - complying energy laws and whose entry to the european union is likely to happen in a longer time frame . * unbundling . most countries understand that the unbundling of transmission companies from their supply businesses is the second critical element of liberalization . to date , unbundling the accounts of these two businesses is all that has been adopted by the member states or in the candidate countries . in the future , the commission is likely to press all eu countries for legal separation (  & structural unbundling  8 ) of the businesses , and candidate countries will have to pursue their reform of the gas sector accordingly . table 1 gives an overview of the state of play in candidate countries . as the table shows , the countries belonging to the second group have only very recently undertaken the reform of the gas sector in accordance with the directive , whereas change had been introduced earlier in the countries scheduled for the first wave . * * end * * follow above url for full report . come shoot the rapids with us at ceraweek 2001 , "" shooting the rapids : strategies and risks for the energy future "" in houston , february 12 - 16 , 2001 !

"energy book hi grant , hope all is well with you . i trust you got my message via the voicemail that ileft with vince late friday afternoon about my inability to travel - i ' m trying to rearrange my trip for a couple of week ' s time when my ear has cleared up , and i look forward to meeting with you one day . i wrote to vince last week asking for a favour , but i ' m not sure ifhe is there in houston . i know that you guys are probably very busy but i was wondering if you can write a few sentences for me . i ' m sending out some sample chapters to the people who responded positively ( all of them ! ) to my request for some feedback on the book . chapter 1 has an ' overview ' of the book with just a couple of sentences on each chapter . could you please write a sentence or two for your chapter ? i ' m including what i have already written ( although i think it has changed slightly from this version ) so that you can see the style . many thanks and best regards . chris . 2 overview of this book this book aims to provide an in - depth understanding of the pricing and risk management of energy derivatives . in the remainder of this chapter we give an overview of the fundamental principals needed to model and price energy assets , and which underlie the rest of the book . as well as introducing the techniques that underlie the black - scholes modelling framework we discuss the numerical techniques of trinomial trees and monte carlo simulation for derivative pricing which are used extensively later in the book . in chapter 2 we analyse spot energy prices . apart from describing empirical prices we propose a number of processes that can be used to model the prices . we look at the well - know process of gbm as well as mean reversion , stochastic volatility and jump processes , discussing each , and showing how they can be simulated and their parameters estimated . chapter 3 , written by vince kaminski and grant masson of enron capital and trade . chapter 4 examines forward curves in the energy markets . although such curves are well understood and straight forward in the world debt markets the difficulty of storage in many energy markets leads to less well defined curves . what we do in this chapter chapter 5 presents an overview of the common and not - so - common derivative structures in the energy markets and discusses their uses . examples of products analysed in this chapter include a variety of swaps , caps , floors and collars , as well as energy swaptions , compound options , asian ( or average rate ) options , barriers , lookbacks , and ladder options . chapter 6 investigates single and multi - factor models of the energy spot price and the pricing of some standard energy derivatives . closed form solutions for forward prices , forward volatilities , and european option prices are derived and presented for all the models in this chapter including a three factor stochastic convenience yield and interest rate model with jumps . chapter 7 shows how the prices of path dependent and american style options can be evaluated for the models in chapter 6 . simulation schemes are developed for the evaluation of european style options and applied to a variety of path dependent options . in order to price options which incorporate early exercise opportunities , a trinomial tree scheme is developed . this tree is built to be consistent with the observed forward curve and can be used to price exotic as well as standard american style options . chapter 8 develops a new methodology for valuing energy options based on modelling the market observed forward curve . the approach results in a multi - factor model that is able to capture realistically the evolution of a wide range of energy forward curves and where the user defined volatility structures can be of an extremely general form . closed - form solutions are developed for pricing standard european options and efficient monte carlo schemes for exotic options . the chapter finishes with a discussion of the valuation of american style options . chapter 9 focuses on the risk management of energy derivative positions . in this chapter we discuss the management of price risk for institutions that sell options or other derivatives to a client and who is then faced with the problem of managing the risk through time . we begin with delta hedging a portfolio containing derivatives and look at extensions to gamma hedging - using the models from chapters 5 and 7 . the general model of chapter 7 ideally suited to multi - factor hedging and this is also discussed . chapter 10 looks at the key risk - management concept of value at risk applied to portfolios containing energy derivative portfolios . after discussing the concept of the measure , we look at how the key inputs ( volatilities , covariances , correlations , etc ) can be estimated . we then compare the fours major methodologies for computing var ; delta , delta - gamma , historical simulation and monte - carlo simulation . finally , we look at testing the var estimates for various underlying energy market variables .",0,energy book hi grant hope well trust got message via voicemail ileft vince late friday afternoon inability travel trying rearrange trip couple week time ear cleared look forward meeting one day wrote vince last week asking favour sure ifhe houston know guys probably busy wondering write sentences sending sample chapters people responded positively request feedback book chapter overview book couple sentences chapter could please write sentence two chapter including already written although think changed slightly version see style many thanks best regards chris overview book book aims provide depth understanding pricing risk management energy derivatives remainder chapter give overview fundamental principals needed model price energy assets underlie rest book well introducing techniques underlie black scholes modelling framework discuss numerical techniques trinomial trees monte carlo simulation derivative pricing used extensively later book chapter analyse spot energy prices apart describing empirical prices propose number processes used model prices look well know process gbm well mean reversion stochastic volatility jump processes discussing showing simulated parameters estimated chapter written vince kaminski grant masson enron capital trade chapter examines forward curves energy markets although curves well understood straight forward world debt markets difficulty storage many energy markets leads less well defined curves chapter chapter presents overview common common derivative structures energy markets discusses uses examples products analysed chapter include variety swaps caps floors collars well energy swaptions compound options asian average rate options barriers lookbacks ladder options chapter investigates single multi factor models energy spot price pricing standard energy derivatives closed form solutions forward prices forward volatilities european option prices derived presented models chapter including three factor stochastic convenience yield interest rate model jumps chapter shows prices path dependent american style options evaluated models chapter simulation schemes developed evaluation european style options applied variety path dependent options order price options incorporate early exercise opportunities trinomial tree scheme developed tree built consistent observed forward curve used price exotic well standard american style options chapter develops new methodology valuing energy options based modelling market observed forward curve approach results multi factor model able capture realistically evolution wide range energy forward curves user defined volatility structures extremely general form closed form solutions developed pricing standard european options efficient monte carlo schemes exotic options chapter finishes discussion valuation american style options chapter focuses risk management energy derivative positions chapter discuss management price risk institutions sell options derivatives client faced problem managing risk time begin delta hedging portfolio containing derivatives look extensions gamma hedging using models chapters general model chapter ideally suited multi factor hedging also discussed chapter looks key risk management concept value risk applied portfolios containing energy derivative portfolios discussing concept measure look key inputs volatilities covariances correlations etc estimated compare fours major methodologies computing var delta delta gamma historical simulation monte carlo simulation finally look testing var estimates various underlying energy market variables

"investment op in proven nasa technology hey , i thought you might like to take a look at viaspace analyst research , report profiling services by ipodesktop . com viaspace , inc . stock symbol : vspc . ob * float : 24 mm ( est ) stock price 7 / 1 / 05 : $ 3 . 45 common shares 6 / 28 / 05 : 283 mm ( est ) recent price range : $ 2 . 80 - $ 3 . 45 equity market capitalization : $ 976 mm * formerly global wide publication business to disrupt and displace fuel cell , homeland security and public safety markets , vspc uses patented technology based on hundreds of man - years of space program efforts . vspc has licensed technology that has been has been nurtured , tested and proven in labs and space by nasa , jpl , caltech and university of southern california ( usc ) . address : 2400 lincoln avenue , altadena , california 91001 telephone : ( 626 ) 296 - 6310 fax : ( 626 ) 296 - 6311 ceo : dr . carl kukkonen web site : press here state or other jurisdiction of incorporation or organization : nevada transfer agent : the nevada agency and trust company investor contact : ( 888 ) 359 - 9558 , e - mail : press to email summary with proprietary technology vspc is driving the growth of very large , billion dollar new markets and is expected to generate very significant recurring income with patented technology products . to gain competitive advantage , strategic partners are willing to integrate vspc ' s products on a worldwide basis . future vspc cost - effective growth is based on the ' fabless business ' model , perfected by the semiconductor industry which , for example , outsources wafer manufacturing to the far east . strong management team a strong management team is the most important , critical ingredient to creating future shareholder value . vspc has a strong management team ( see below ) . large rapidly growing markets in general , to increase shareholder value a company must participate in rapidly growing markets , and should try to be a significant player in targeted markets . vspc expects to dominate billion dollar markets that do not exist today , by introducing ' believe it or not ' technology innovations that create and expand markets . "" breakthrough "" products in the vspc pipeline vpsc products in the process of commercialization are expected to enable up to 10 hours of laptop computer usage , and three weeks of cell phone operation using fuel cells , gps - free navigation , especially for places where gps doesn ' t work ( a top dod priority ) , automated analysis of air and seaport cargo containers based on x - ray imaging ( homeland security ) , identification of narcotics , chemicals , and biological weapons . another total breakthrough , with a nanotechnology based mass spectrometer is a portable , carry - on suitcase size device that processes identifies one molecule at a time : further miniaturization is expected to shoebox size , compared with stationary desk size provided by today ' s competitors . significant recurring income from fuel cell batteries in five years , annual revenue from disposable fuel cartridges for fuel cell - powered portable electronic devices is expected to range between $ 7 billion on the low side to $ 45 billion on the high side . that market does not exist today . vspc ' s fuel cell cartridge business model is similar to the well - known razor / razor blade model , which is to sell the razor and then make much more money on the recurring blade business . the fuel cell is a razor , and the disposable fuel cartridge is the razor blade . another analogy is the flashlight / battery model . imagine if a company had the primary intellectual property involved in manufacturing flashlights . it would probably license that technology to major flashlight manufacturers , in return for help in dominating the recurring flashlight battery business . in this case vspc has the proprietary rights to the ' flashlight ' - - the fuel cell - - and intends to sell the "" flashlight battery "" - - specifically , disposable fuel cartridges , for an end - user price of $ 2 - $ 3 each . vspc is currently negotiating to provide its patented fuel cell technology to major computer manufacturers , in return for their agreement to use disposable fuel cartridges developed by vspc , the manufacturing of which will be outsourced to well - known , major plants in the far east . intellectual property protected with patents vspc ' s fuel cell technology , for example , is protected by over 70 issued and pending patents . strategic partners lend credibility to create a cost - effective worldwide footprint , emerging companies must partner with branded , global companies who have strong management teams and significant resources . vspc is partnering with major , well - known market leaders who have management , resources and global branding . partners are attracted to vspc ' s technology , and expect to gain competitive advantage by integrating patented , proprietary technology obtained from vspc . for example , in the fuel cell business , toshiba , nec , sanyo , hitachi and samsung have unveiled prototype fuel cell powered products that more than double the operating time over existing battery technology . these companies are potential strategic partners for vspc . to better work with japanese manufacturers , vspc has opened a tokyo office . "" fabless "" business model enables cost - effective growth fabless semiconductor chip companies design and develop proprietary chips , then outsource manufacturing to wafer plants in the far east . some well - known fabless semiconductor companies , ranked by market capitalization , include $ 12 billion market cap , broadcom ( brcm ) press here to view $ 11 billion market cap , marvell semiconductor ( mrvl ) press here to view $ 9 billion market cap , xilinx ( xlnx ) press here to view $ 7 . 3 billion market cap , altera ( altr ) press here to view $ 4 . 5 billion market cap , nvidia corp ( nvda ) press here to view $ 4 . 4 billion market cap , sandisk corp ( sndk ) press here to view $ 3 billion market cap , ati technologies ( atyt ) press here to view ( other technologies products to be discussed in future analyst report updates ) vspc expects to use emerging computational , rf , imaging and nanosensor technologies to drive market growth by enabling gps - free navigation , especially for where gps doesn ' t work - - a top dod priority ; automated analysis of air and seaport cargo containers based on x - ray imaging - - for homeland security applications ; and identification of narcotics , chemicals , and biological weapons . when appropriate we will also provide updates on projects currently under review , which include a water purification technology and interactive radio . management chief executive officer : dr . carl kukkonen , ceo and founding partner . prior to founding viaspace technologies llc , dr . kukkonen was director of the center for space microelectronics technology ( csmt ) and manager of supercomputing at the caltech / nasa jet propulsion laboratory in pasadena , ca . at jpl , dr . kukkonen managed several technologies and technical teams , including the technical foundation of viaspace ' s operating subsidiaries . among his major accomplishments , dr . kukkonen built the center for space microelectronics into a 250 man operation with a $ 70 m annual budget from nothing over the course of his 14 -

"alliance info alert - ferc reporting attached is a summary of recent ferc activities ( pdf file ) and the weekly alliance express . the following is a summary of the most recent ferc meeting , followed by a listing of the most recent ferc filings . in a brief meeting yesterday , ferc approved a final rule adopting section 203 merger filing requirements , generally as proposed , and extended the existing nyiso bid cap in its non - spinning reserves market and the related mandatory bidding requirement until such time that the new york market can be determined to be "" workably competitive . "" at the same time , ferc ordered a technical conference to explore changes to the nyiso reserves market , and urged market participants to reach a consensus on a preferred solution , next steps , and deadlines for resolution / implementation . additional details are provided below . ferc updates , streamlines merger filing process ferc unanimously approved its proposed order revising the reporting requirements for mergers . however , comm . hebert did so with reservations , as discussed below . commission staff stated that the order closely follows the notice of proposed rulemaking previously issued , but adds more detail and more certainty to the industry . staff stated that the order is improved over the proposed rule because it includes exemptions from reporting for certain entities and it more precisely defines geographical areas and products . according to ferc , the draft order : - revises the commission ' s filing requirements to reflect existing merger policy based on ferc ' s 1996 merger policy guidelines ; - provides more detail for the industry in developing competitive market analyses . the rule continues the existing screening process for mergers with potential horizontal competitive concerns . in addition , the rule establishes informational requirements for vertical competitive analyses . - streamlines filing requirements for transactions that do not raise competitive concerns ; and - reduces the industry ' s regulatory burden by eliminating outdated filing requirements . the rule will take effect 60 days after its publication in the federal register . commissioner reaction : comm . hebert expressed reservations that , although he was voting for the rule , ferc should not be duplicating the department of justice ( doj ) and the federal trade commission ( ftc ) market concentration analyses and that ferc should follow the lead of anti - trust enforcement officials , who could also analyze mergers faster and more confidentially . he also stated that ferc should review the filings after the doj or the ftc review them , not before , and that there should be a definite time frame for review . hebert did mention that he was pleased that rtos and the disposition of transmission assets would be exempt , that ancillary services would be considered as a separate product and that the final rule opens the door for alternative market analysis . comm . breathitt supported the final rule , stating that it should expedite the approval process and that the regulatory burden should be eased due to the fact that older , irrelevant requirements have been dropped . she indicated that the final rule balanced the need for speedy decisions while protecting the public interest by stating that the process will be "" efficient yet sufficient "" . the commissioner said that she was pleased the final rule addressed technical issues such as computer modeling as well as retail competition and one of her main concerns , confidentiality . comm . massey fully supported the final rule , emphasizing that it would improve response time , lessen the need to ask for more data and allow the industry to better predict commission actions . like commissioner breathitt , massey was pleased that the order will allow market modeling analysis that will better enable ferc to evaluate market concentration and allow applicants to point to other factors when concentration appears too high . massey also stated that the new rule includes the ability to address many of ferc ' s concerns , such as future mergers when they occur in succession , retail competition , mitigation by the enlargement of markets through rtos and analysis of ancillary services . in sum , he averred that the order will provide ferc with the tools it needs for accurate analysis , while taking into consideration the rapid changes in the industry . chairman hoecker also voiced his support and noted that he felt that this was a very important rule . in response to comm . hebert , chairman hoecker said that the doj and ftc actually wait for ferc ' s report before issuing their own , that the anti - trust enforcement agencies rely on ferc ' s expertise when reviewing mergers in the electric and gas industries . there is a major positive connection between industry consolidation and rtos and that both are reconfiguring the markets and effect how they work , he noted . because the rtos enlarge the size of the subject market , he indicated , rtos will help to preserve competition . therefore , more and larger rtos should allow for more mergers , he said . the chairman cautioned that this is not to imply that joining an rto is a requirement for a merger , but that it would certainly be viewed favorably . nyiso bid caps extended until ancillary service market shown to be workably competitive in a 3 - 1 decision , with comm . hebert dissenting , ferc extended the existing nyiso bid cap in its non - spinning reserves market and the related mandatory bidding requirement until such time as that market can be determined to be "" workably competitive . "" at the same time , ferc ordered a technical conference to explore changes to the nyiso reserves market , and urged market participants to reach a consensus on a preferred solution , next steps , and deadlines for resolution / implementation . in so doing , ferc rejected certain aspects of nyiso ' s september 1 and 8 , 2000 compliance filing , submitted pursuant to its may 31 , 2000 order imposing a temporary bid cap through october 31 . the iso ' s efforts to correct market flaws identified in the order and further strengthen market performance had not yet satisfied the commission ' s directives , ferc concluded . ferc found that while nyiso has achieved solid progress in certain areas , overall the iso has not shown sufficient improvement to warrant raising and then gradually lifting the temporary bid cap in the iso ' s non - spinning reserve market by april 2001 , as the iso requested . commissioner reaction : comms . hoecker , massey and breathitt all endorsed the order as an "" imperfect solution , "" yet a pragmatic approach toward resolving the flaws plaguing the iso ' s market . comm . hebert faulted the commission for squandering an opportunity to incentivize additional supply by lifting the price controls . hoecker and breathitt joined hebert in expressing disappointment in the lack of the iso ' s progress , but contended that significant outstanding issues must be resolved before the bid cap can be lifted . in other action , ferc accepted nyiso ' s and nepool ' s proposed emergency energy transaction agreement , allowing nyiso and iso - ne to provide emergency service to each other ( ero 0 - 3638 - 000 ) ; stricken items included cae - 16 ( nepool ' s 64 th agreement amendment proposing the elimination of in service and instituting new rules governing certain import transactions ( ero 0 - 3577 - 000 ) ) . = = recent ferc filings = = ( 1 ) rto developments * iso ne submitted its changes to market rule 17 , market monitoring , reporting and market power mitigation , in compliance with the commission ' s july 26 , 2000 order . erol - 368 - 000 . filed november 1 , 2000 . * iso ne submitted its special interim market rule in compliance with the commission ' s july 26 , 2000 order . ero 0 - 369 - 000 . filed november 1 , 2000 . * illinois industrial energy consumers filed to intervene regarding dynegy ' s filing to request approval for the withdrawal of the illinois power co . from the miso . erol - 123 - 000 . filed november 6 , 2000 . * el segundo power filed a motion "" requesting order on request for rehearing by date certain "" in complaint that challenges the ca iso ' s ability to set the rates for the energy that it can compel generators to produce for reliability under its standard form contract . ero 0 - 1830 - 001 . filed november 3 , 2000 . * ca iso filed an unbundled grid management charge in order to recover its administrative and operating costs . erol - 313 - 000 . comments due by november 22 , 2000 . * nepool submitted supplemental information related to its filing of the sixty - fourth agreement amending the nepool agreement , which proposed the elimination of in service . ero 0 - 3577 - 000 . comments due by november 14 , 2000 .

( i will be glad to put this additional pricing provision into the agreement if you decide to move forward . ) i felt i was able to communicate the philosophy , scope , and operation of our approach during the meeting and to deliver you much of the information you might need to evaluate whether marketpoint meets your needs . i thought you were able to see the depth and sophistication of the product yet at the same time its simplicity and effectiveness . i thought you were able to see the benefits of the marketpoint dimension of economic equilibrium as a complement and supplement to other approaches you will assuredly use . i would be interested in your impressions and those of your colleagues . i look forward to your response and to moving ahead together . we view you as a very important prospective customer and client and will work with you to earn and secure your business . if you decide to license marketpoint , we can arrange to transfer and mount marketpoint and the short term narg model ( which is the model we suggest you begin with ) and travel to houston to deliver our 1 day training seminar . our clients are usually very fluent after that 1 day training seminar . thereafter , we would want you to work with the short term narg model for a few weeks while you get up to speed , very fluent , and very comfortable before you take delivery of the longer term version of narg several weeks later . thanks again , and all the best . if there is some item from the meeting that i might have forgotten to send , please remind me . my notes don ' t show anything , but i was speaking a lot rather than writing notes during the meeting and might have overlooked something someone wanted . dale nesbitt president marketpoint inc . 27121 adonna ct . los altos hills , ca 94022 ( 650 ) 218 -

keeping . no one will ever come forward to claim it . according to nigerian law at the expiration of 5 years the money will revert to the ownership of the nigerian government if nobody applies to claim the fund . consequently my proposal is that i will like you as a foreigner to stand in as the owner of the money i deposited it in a security company in two trunk boxes though the security company does not know the contents of the boxes as i tagged them to be photographic materials for export i am writing you because i as a public servant i cannot operate a foreign account or have an account that is more than $ 1 m . i want to present you as the owner of the boxes in the security company so you can be able to claim them with the help of my attorney . all these are to make sure that the fruits of this old man ' s labour will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials . this is simple . i will like you to provide immediately your full names and address so that the attorney will prepare the necessary documents which will put you in place as the owner of the boxes . the money will be shared in the ratio of 70 % for me and 25 % for you and 5 % will take care of all expenses . there is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the attorney and this will guarantee the successful execution of this transaction . if you are interested , please reply immediately via my private email address . upon your response i shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction . please observe with utmost confidentiality and be rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because i shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country . awaiting your urgent reply via my private email to indicate your interest . thanks and regards , mr . vincent nnaji .",1,business partnership urgent confidential mr vincent nnaji standard trust bank ltd lagos nigeria dear sir mr vincent nnaji bank manager standard trust bank lagos nigeria urgent confidential business proposition january foreign oil consultant foreign contractor nigerian national petroleum corporation mr james herbert made numbered time fixed deposit twelve calendar months valued us twenty million united states dollars branch upon maturity sent routine notification forwarding address got reply month sent reminder finally discovered contract employers nigerian national petroleum corporation mr james herbert died automobile accident investigation found died without making attempts trace next kin fruitless therefore made investigation discovered mr james herbert declare next kin relations official documents including bank deposit paperwork bank sum us carefully moved bank security company safe keeping one ever come forward claim according nigerian law expiration years money revert ownership nigerian government nobody applies claim fund consequently proposal like foreigner stand owner money deposited security company two trunk boxes though security company know contents boxes tagged photographic materials export writing public servant operate foreign account account want present owner boxes security company able claim help attorney make sure fruits old man labour get hands corrupt government officials simple like provide immediately full names address attorney prepare necessary documents put place owner boxes money shared ratio take care expenses risk paperwork transaction done attorney guarantee successful execution transaction interested please reply immediately via private email address upon response shall provide details relevant documents help understand transaction please observe utmost confidentiality rest assured transaction would profitable us shall require assistance invest share country awaiting urgent reply via private email indicate interest thanks regards mr vincent nnaji

"[ ilug ] assistance from : col . michael bundu . democratic republic of congo . tel no : your country intl . access code + 8821652098236 email : mikebundu @ rediffmail . com dear sir / madam seeking your immediate assistance . please permit me to make your acquaintance in so informal a manner . this is necessitated by my urgent need to reach a dependable and trust worthy foreign partner . this request may seem strange and unsolicited but i crave your indulgence and pray that you view it seriously . my name is col . michael bundu of the democratic republic of congo and one of the close aides to the former president of the democratic republic of congo laurent kabila of blessed memory , may his soul rest in peace . due to the military campaign of laurent kabila to force out the rebels in my country , i and some of my colleagues were instructed by late president kabila to go abroad to purchase arms and ammunition worth of twenty million , five hundred thousand united states dollars only ( us $ 20 , 500 , 000 . 00 ) to fight the rebel group . we were then given this money privately by the then president , laurent kabila , without the knowledge of other cabinet members . but when president kabila was killed in a bloody shoot - out by one of his bodyguards a day before we were schedule to travel out of congo , we immediately decided to put the funds into a private security company here in congo for safe keeping . the security of the said amount is presently being threatened here following the arrest and seizure of properties of col . rasheidi karesava ( one of the aides to laurent kabila ) a tribesman , and some other military personnel from our same tribe , by the new president of the democratic republic of congo , the son of late president laurent kabila , joseph kabila . in view of this , we need a reliable and trustworthy foreign partner who can assist us to move this money out of my country as the beneficiary . we have sufficient ' ' contacts ' ' here to move the fund under diplomatic cover to a security company in europe in your name . this is to ensure that the diplomatic baggage is marked ' ' confidential ' ' and it will not pass through normal custom / airport screening and clearance . our inability to move this money out of congo all this while stems from our lack of trust of our supposed good friends ( western countries ) who suddenly became hostile to those of us who worked with the late president kabila , immediately after his son took office . though we have neither seen nor met each other , the information we gathered from an associate who has worked in your country has encouraged and convinced us that with your sincere assistance , this transaction will be properly handled with modesty and honesty to a huge success within two weeks . the said money is a state fund and therefore requires a total confidentiality . we would please need you to stand on our behalf as the beneficiary of this fund in europe . this is because we are under restricted movement and watch and hence we want to be very careful in order not to lose this fund which we have worked so hard for . thus , if you are willing to assist us to move this fund out of congo , you can contact me through my email addresses , tel / fax nos . above with your telephone , fax number and personal information to enable us discuss the modalities and what will be your share ( percentage ) for assisting us . please note that there are no risks involved in this deal as everyone ' s security is guaranteed if we follow the required guidelines . i will hence furnish you with further details of this deal as soon as i am assured of your sincere interest to assist us . i must use this opportunity and medium to implore you to exercise the utmost indulgence to keep this matter extraordinarily confidential , whatever your decision , while i await your prompt response . thank you and god bless . best regards col . michael bundu ( rtd ) . m _ bundu @ rediffmail . com n \ b . when you are calling my line , you dial your country intl . access code , then you dial directly , do not include my country code i . e .

"refined products line - - north american markets - cera alert : decem ber 15 , 2000 cera alert : december 15 , 2000 title : refined products line - - north american markets cera knowledge areas : refined products us margin highlights * responding to falling apparent demand and rising primary inventory levels , us gulf coast unleaded gasoline margins versus wti fell by $ 2 . 26 per barrel to average $ 1 . 45 per barrel during november . gasoline margins have returned to a historically normal range after spending the summer of 2000 at exceptionally high values . cera expects gasoline margins to wti to average $ 2 . 75 per barrel during the first quarter of the new year , $ 1 . 16 per barrel lower than this year ' s first quarter average . * high sulfur no . 2 fuel oil differentials with wti dropped slightly , averaging $ 5 . 97 per barrel in november . despite the drop of $ 0 . 37 per barrel from october ' s average , fuel oil differentials remain at unprecedented values - $ 4 . 20 per barrel higher than a year ago and $ 3 . 46 per barrel greater that the previous five - year average . for the first quarter of 2001 , cera anticipates distillate margins to moderate somewhat but remain at a record high level of $ 4 . 75 per barrel in the first quarter . * jet / kerosene differentials versus wti rose $ 0 . 63 per barrel from the october average , reaching a whopping $ 8 . 59 per barrel in november . in correspondence with the distillate market , jet / kerosene margins are at historically high levels and receiving support from relatively tight fundamentals . cera expects jet / kerosene margins to moderate somewhat in the first quarter in response to seasonal weakening of demand following the holiday travel season but to remain exceptionally strong at an average of $ 5 . 75 per barrel . * margins for us gulf coast 1 % sulfur residual fuel dropped by $ 2 . 15 per barrel , reaching $ 3 . 99 per barrel below wti during november . despite the recent widening of differentials , cera expects soaring natural gas prices to support relatively narrow residual fuel differentials throughout the winter months . residual fuel differentials are expected to average $ 2 . 50 per barrel below wti during the first quarter of next year , at the high end of the historical range . us demand highlights * apparent demand for unleaded gasoline fell seasonally by about 0 . 5 million barrels per day ( mbd ) from the october level , reaching 8 . 36 mbd for the four weeks ending december 8 . demand is averaging less than 1 percent below last year largely because y 2 k concerns helped inflate december demand a year ago . cera anticipates gasoline demand to continue to decline seasonally as colder temperatures arrive , averaging 8 . 08 mbd during the first quarter of 2001 . * reported distillate apparent demand remains exceptionally strong at 3 . 94 mbd for the four weeks ending december 8 , over 7 percent greater than this time last year . this represents a slight increase of about 0 . 05 million barrels ( mb ) from the end - october level of 3 . 90 mb , but still a record high level for early december . with support from low home heating oil inventories , particularly in the northeast , distillate demand has been very strong during the fall of 2000 . cera expects demand to remain strong in the coming winter months , averaging 3 . 79 mb during the first quarter of next year . * apparent demand for jet fuel declined by 5 percent from the october level to reach 1 . 68 mbd for the four weeks ending december 8 . despite the decline , apparent jet fuel demand is over 1 percent above the year - ago level . the relative strength of jet fuel reported demand continues to parallel distillate demand strength with support coming from the use of jet fuel to help mitigate the tight distillate market fundamentals . cera expects the demand for jet fuel to average 1 . 81 mb during the fourth quarter . * reported demand for residual fuel dropped to 0 . 87 mbd for the four weeks ending december 8 , a decline of about 0 . 09 mbd from the october average and a slight increase over the november level . demand for residual fuel is currently 11 percent greater than last year , and surging natural gas prices are expected to result in continued strong residual fuel demand throughout the winter . residual fuel demand is expected to remain in the 0 . 85 to 0 . 9 mbd range during the first quarter of 2001 . us inventory highlights * primary inventories of unleaded gasoline rose to 196 . 5 mb , increasing almost 10 mb from the end - october value . responding to rising stock levels and declining apparent demand , forward supply coverage of gasoline climbed to 23 . 5 days for the four weeks ending december 8 . forward supply is 2 . 5 percent below last year ' s level at this time of year and at its lowest level in the past eight years - although cera still believes coverage is currently sufficient for the level of demand expected this winter . however , cera is looking cautiously at the implications of high distillate refinery yields and production because of the possibility of low gasoline inventories at the start of the driving season in the second quarter of next year . * distillate inventory coverage has remained about level since the end of october at 29 . 2 days of forward supply for the four weeks ending december 8 . despite record high apparent demand , strong refinery production levels helped boost primary distillate inventories slightly , to 115 . 3 mb for this period . primary stocks are 16 percent below last year ' s level at this time and at their lowest historical level ever . although stocks are low , cera does not anticipate shortages to occur this winter . assuming normally cold weather , refinery production and net imports are expected to be capable of meeting demand requirements - albeit at a high price . * jet fuel inventory coverage crept upward by about 1 day of coverage , to reach 25 . 7 days of forward supply for the four weeks ending december 8 . this moves jet fuel coverage above the 23 . 5 to 25 days ' supply range that it had been in for the past four months . the rise of just under 1 day in forward supply was mainly a response to a decline in apparent demand . jet inventories and coverage are expected to become tighter in the coming weeks as the pull from tight distillate markets strengthen , but supplies are expected to be adequate for the winter . * inventory coverage of residual fuel rose by almost 4 days of forward supply from october , reaching 41 . 7 days of forward supply during the four weeks ending december 8 . the increase in coverage was a temporary response to a drop in demand and an increase in stocks . with demand expected to strengthen because of colder weather and high gas prices , cera looks for inventories and coverage gradually to decline in the coming weeks . * * end * * this cera alert will be available in pdf format within 24 hours . this electronic message and attachments , if any , contain information from cambridge energy research associates , inc .

"capital hill gold - chgi - potential high grade gold deposit breaking news : denver , june 14 , 2005 ( business wire ) - - capital hill gold , inc , ( chgi ) reports that the company ' s geologists are evaluating a potential high - grade bulk - tonnage gold deposit located in mineral county , nevada , the project is situated in the vicinity of several operating and past - producing gold mines , including the paradise peak , santa fe and rawhide deposits , after review of usgs geochemical survey work of the project and a study of the geology of other gold deposits in the area , geologists believe that the target would be a high - grade bulk - tonnage gold deposit , virgin deposits : the privately - held 440 - acre project was originally staked by a major gold mining company in the 1990 s , the property has never been drilled and may prove to be a rich vein as early tests have indicated , follow - up work by the company ' s geologist indicated that a major international gold mining company had staked approximately 200 unpatented lode - mining claims in the area during 2001 and 2002 , geologists investigating the property for capital hill observed multiple broad zones of silicification extending for considerable distances , samples were collected from several outcrops on the property , and have been submitted to american assay labs in elko , nevada for assaying , based on positive assay results , target and identification , a major claim - staking program will be launched accordingly , as further credible evidence emerges of a significant gold ore deposit , and the first results coming in are showing promise , on june 13 , 2005 the company announced in a press release that capital hill ' s management is pleased and encouraged with the first u 3 o 8 ( uranium oxide ) assay returns as well as the noticeable precious metal results and that initial reconnaissance sampling on the company ' s uranium project has returned assays grading 0 , 061 % u 3 o 8 to 0 , 068 % u 3 o 8 of great interest to the company is the fact that the samples taken also assayed positively for precious metals , with results ranging from 0 , 08 to 0 , 22 oz ag / st and trace amounts of gold , the occurrence of silver in conjunction with the uranium mineralization warrants further investigation . the recent news of the company possibly sitting on a huge untapped gold deposit has the stock in a strong up trend , rallying from 5 cents to 75 cents during the past three months . as the three - month chart illustrates , trading volume has swelled to 300 , 000 shares per day with money flow indicators showing strong inflows , which is representative of a stock that is under accumulation . the positive tape action clearly shows strong investor sentiment about the company ' s leverage on controlling sizable parcels of gold fields . the potential recoverable gold data has yet to be compiled , but as mentioned above , early tests are very promising , which is why investors are bidding up shares ahead of this data . capital hill gold ' s strategic objective is to obtain controlling interests in properties with excellent exploration potential to become economically significant to world - class ore deposits . chgi intends to acquire mineral exploration properties primarily through the filing of concessions on its own account and in partnership as well as by optioning exceptional properties at reasonable costs relative to the property ' s potential and the financial capabilities of the company . in recent weeks , chgi shareholders have been on the receiving end of some very promising developments with the new discoveries for gold ore . in addition , the company is aggressively exploring for commercial grade uranium deposits that will supply newly heightened demand from nuclear utilities . since 2003 uranium prices have doubled . 20 % of the world ' s electricity comes from uranium , and the nuclear power plant count is stable and growing . the united states needs to add about 100 nuclear power plants over the next two decades to meet burgeoning demand for electric power and maintain the current generating mix , nils j . diaz , chairman of the u . s . nuclear regulatory commission told reporters in early may 2005 . as of may 17 , 2005 the company is pleased to report that the claim staking crew and geologist have arrived on site , and have begun staking claims . the area being staked encompasses a large area of potentially commercial - grade uranium mineralization identified by previous work , including geophysical surveys . reconnaissance sampling of the ground being staked has returned assay results approximately equal to those of in - place resources at one of the past - producing uranium mines in the project area . a chinese news web site reports that china , the world ' s second - largest energy consumer after the u . s . , will spend 400 billion yuan ( u . s . $ 48 . 33 billion ) on building new nuclear power plants by 2020 . this is a bigger number than we have seen in the past . the energy - hungry country intends to increase the amount of installed nuclear power capacity from the current 16 gigawatts to 40 gigawatts within 15 years . nuclear power generation is expected to triple to reach 60 gigawatts by that time . so the market for uranium is in a new bull market . conclusion development efforts for gold and uranium on chgi properties are about to commence following the better - than - expected geophysical testing results . shares of chgi have rallied over 10 - fold in just the past three months in anticipation of what the future holds in the way of extractible gold and uranium . once full mining operations are under way , it is our view , that the shares will rally as the business generates its initial revenue stream . for additional information , visit investor relations solutions is a communications arm of ir solutions profiles . investor relations solutions

"" that ' s why i ' m sitting up here and you are all sitting out there ! "" with network marketing you have two sources of income . direct commissions from sales you make yourself and commissions from sales made by people you introduce to the business . residual income is the secret of the wealthy . it means investing time and money once , and getting paid again and again and again . in network marketing , it also means getting paid for the work of others . the enclosed information is something i almost let slip through my fingers . fortunately , sometime later i reread everything and gave some thought and study to it . my name is jonathan rourke . two years ago , the corporation i worked at for the past twelve years down - sized and my position was eliminated . after unproductive job interviews , i decided to open my own business . over the past year , i incurred many unforeseen financial problems . i owed my family , friends and creditors over $ 35 , 000 . the economy was taking a toll on my business and i just couldn ' t seem to make ends meet . i had to refinance and borrow against my home to support my family and struggling business . at that moment something significant happened in my life and i am writing to share that experience in hopes that this will change your life forever financially ! ! ! in mid december , i received this program via e - mail . six month ' s prior to receiving this program , i had been sending away for information on various business opportunities . all of the programs i received , in my opinion were not cost effective . they were either too difficult for me to comprehend or the initial investment was too much for me to risk to see if they would work or not . one claimed that i would make a million dollars in one year . it didn ' t tell me i ' d have to write a book to make it ! but like i was saying , in december i received this program . i didn ' t send for it , or ask for it ; they just got my name off a mailing list . thank goodness for that ! ! ! after reading it several times , to make sure i was reading it correctly , i couldn ' t believe my eyes . here was a money making phenomenon . i could invest as much as i wanted to start without putting me further into debt . after i got a pencil and paper and figured it out , i would at least get my money back . but like most of you i was still a little skeptical and a little worried about the legal aspects of it all . so i checked it out with the u . s . post office ( 1 - 800 - 725 - 2161 24 hrs ) and they confirmed that it is indeed legal ! after determining the program was legal and not a chain letter , i decided "" why not . "" initially i sent out 10 , 000 e - mails . it cost me about $ 15 for my time on - line . the great thing about e - mail is that i don ' t need any money for printing to send out the program , and because all of my orders are filled via e - mail , the only expense is my time . i am telling you like it is . i hope it doesn ' t turn you off , but i promised myself that i would not ' rip - off "" anyone , no matter how much money it cost me . here is the basic version of what you need to do : your first goal is to receive at least 20 orders for report # 1 within 2 weeks of your first program going out . if you don ' t , send out more programs until you do . your second goal is to receive at least 150 + orders for report # 2 within 4 weeks . if not , send out more programs until you do . once you have your 150 orders , relax , you ' ve met your goal . you will make $ 50 , 000 + but keep at it ! if you don ' t get 150 right off , keep at it ! it may take some time for your down line to build . keep at it , stay focused , and do not let yourself get distracted . in less than one week , i was starting to receive orders for report # 1 . i kept at it - kept mailing out the program and by january 13 , 1 had received 26 orders for report # 1 . my first step in making $ 50 , 000 in 90 days was done . by january 30 , 1 had received 196 orders for report # 2 ; 46 more than i needed . so i sat back and relaxed . by march 1 , of my e - mailing of 10 , 000 , i received $ 58 , 000 with more coming in every day . i paid off all my debts and bought a much needed new car . please take time to read the attached program , it will change your life forever ! ! remember , it won ' t work if you don ' t try it . this program does work , but you must follow it exactly ! especially the rules of not trying to place your name in a different place . it won ' t work , you ' ll lose out on a lot of money ! in order for this program to work very fast , try to meet your goal of 20 + orders for report # 1 , and 150 + orders for report # 2 and you will make $ 50 , 000 or more in 90 days . if you don ' t reach the first two goals with in four weeks , relax , you will still make a ton of money , it may take a few months or so longer . but keep mailing out the programs and stay focused ! that ' s the key . i am living proof that it works ! ! ! if you choose not to participate in this program , i am sorry . it really is a great opportunity with little cost or risk to you . if you choose to participate , follow the program and you will be on your way to financial security . if you are a fellow business owner and are in financial trouble like i was , or you want to start your own business , consider this a sign . i did ! - sincerely , jonathan rourke p . s . do you have any idea what 11 , 700 $ 5 bills ( $ 58 , 000 ) look like piled up on a kitchen table ? it ' s awesome ! a personal note from the originator of this program : by the time you have read the enclosed program and reports , you should have concluded that such a program , and one that is legal , could not have been created by an amateur . let me tell you a little about myself . i had a profitable business for 10 years . then in 1979 my business began falling off . i was doing the same things that were previously successful for me , but it wasn ' t working . finally , i figured it out . it wasn ' t me ; it was the economy . inflation and recession had replaced the stable economy that had been with us since 1945 . i don ' t have to tell you what happened to the unemployment rate . . . because many of you know from first hand experience . there were more failures and bankruptcies than ever before . the middle class was vanishing . those who knew what they were doing invested wisely and moved up . those who did not including those who never had anything to save or invest were moving down into the ranks of the poor . as the saying goes , ' the rich get richer and the poor get poorer . "" the traditional methods of making money will never allow you to "" move up "" or "" get rich "" . inflation will see to that . you have just received information that can give you financial freedom for the rest of your life , with "" no risk "" and "" just a little bit of effort . "" you can make more money in the next few months than you have ever imagined . follow the program exactly as instructed . do not change it in any way . it works exceedingly well as it is now . remember to e - mail a copy of this exciting report to everyone you can think of . one of the people you send this to may send out 50 , 000 . . . and your name will be on everyone of them ! remember though , the more you send out the more potential customers you will reach . so my friend , i have given you the ideas , information , materials and opportunity to become financially independent . it is up to you now ! "" think about it . "" before you delete this program from your mailbox , as i almost did , take a little time to read it and really think about it . get a pencil and figure out what could happen when you participate . figure out the worst possible response and no matter how you calculate it , you will still make a lot of money ! you will definitely get back what you invested . any doubts you have will vanish when your first orders come in . it works ! - jody jacobs , richmond , va here ' s how this amazing program will make you thousands of dollar $ this method of raising capital really works 100 % every time . i am sure that you could use up to $ 50 , 000 or more in the next 90 days . before you say "" no way ! "" please read this program carefully . this is not a chain letter , but a perfectly legal money making opportunity . basically , this is what you do : as with all multilevel businesses , we - build our business by recruiting new partners and selling our products . every state in the usa allows you to recruit new multilevel business partners , and we offer a product for every dollar sent . your orders come by mail and are filled by e - mail , so you are not involved in personal selling . you do it privately in your own home , store , or office . this is the greatest multi - level mail order marketing anywhere : this is what you must do . 1 . order all 5 reports shown on the list below ( you can ' t sell them if you don ' t have them ) . * for each report , send $ 5 . 00 cash , the name & number of the report you are ordering , your e - mail address , and your name & return address ( in case of a problem ) . * make sure your return address is on your envelope - in case of any mail problems ! * when you place your order , make sure you order each of the five reports . you need all five reports so that you can save them on your computer and resell them . * within a few days you will receive , via e - mail , each of the five reports . save them on your computer so they will be accessible for you to send to the 1 , 000 ' s of people who will order them from you . 2 . important - do not alter the names of the people who are listed next to each report , or their order on the list in any way other than as instructed below in steps "" a "" through ' g "" or you will lose out on the majority of your profits . once you understand the way this works you ' ll also see how it doesn ' t work if you change it . remember , this method has been tested , and if you alter it , it will not work . a . look below for the listing of available reports . b . after you ' ve ordered the . five reports , take this advertisement and remove the name and address under report # 5 . this person has made it through the cycle and is no doubt counting their $ 50 , 000 ! c . move the name and address under report # 4 down to report # 5 . d . move the name and address under report # 3 down to report # 4 . e . move the name and address under report # 2 down to report # 3 f . move the name and address under report # 1 down to report # 2 . g . insert your name and address in the report # 1 position . please make sure you copy every name and address accurately ! copy and paste method works well , . 3 . take this entire letter , including the modified list of names , and save it to your computer . make no changes to the instruction portion of this letter . your cost to participate in this is practically nothing ( surely you can afford $ 25 ) . you obviously already have an internet connection and e - mail is free ! to assist you with marketing your business on the internet , the 5 reports you purchase will provide you with invaluable marketing information which includes how to send bulk e - mails , where to find thousands of free classified ads and much , much more . here are two primary methods of building your downline : method # 1 : sending bulk e - mail let ' s say that you decide to start small , just to see how it goes , and we ' ll assume you and all those involved send out only 2 , 000 programs each . let ' s also assume that the mailing receives a 0 . 5 % response . using a good list , the response could be much better . also , many people will send out hundreds of thousands of programs instead of 2 , 000 . but continuing with this example , you send out only 2 , 000 programs . with a 0 . 5 % response , that is only 10 orders for report # 1 . those 10 people respond by sending out 2 , 000 programs each for a total of 20 , 000 . out of those 0 . 5 % , 100 people respond and order report # 2 . those 100 mail out 2 , 000 programs each for a total of 200 , 000 . the 0 . 5 % response to that is 1 , 000 orders for report # 3 . those 1 , 000 send out 2 , 000 programs each for a 2 , 000 , 000 total . the 0 . 5 % response to that is i 0 , 000 orders for report # 4 . that amounts to 10 , 000 each of $ 5 bills for you in cash money ! then think about level five ! that ' s $ 500 , 000 alone ! your total income in this example is $ 50 + $ 500 + $ 5 , 000 + $ 50 , 000 + $ 500 , 000 for a total of $ 555 , 550 ! ! ! remember friend , this is assuming 1 , 990 out of the 2 , 000 people you mail to will do absolutely nothing and trash this program ! dare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone , or half sent out 100 , 000 programs instead of 2 , 000 . believe me , many people will do just that and more ! report # 2 will show you the best methods for bulk e - mailing , and e - mail software . method # 2 - placing free ads on the internet 1 . advertising on the net is very , very inexpensive , and there are hundreds of free places to advertise . let ' s say you decide to start small just to see how well it works . assume your goal is to get only 10 people to participate on your first level . placing a lot of free ads on the internet will easily get a larger response . also assume that everyone else in your organization gets only 10 downline members . follow this example to achieve the staggering results below : lst level - your 10 members with $ 5 . . . . . . . $ 50 2 nd level - 10 members from those 10 ( $ 5 x 100 ) . . . . . . . $ 500 3 rd level - 10 members from those 100 ( $ 5 x 1 , 000 ) . . . . . . . $ 5 , 000 4 th level - 10 members from those 1 , 000 ( $ 5 x 10 k ) . . . . . . . $ 50 , 000 5 th level - 10 members from those 10 , 000 ( $ 5 x 100 k ) . . . . . . . $ 500 , 000 this totals - $ 555 , 550 remember friends , this assumes that the people who participate only recruit 10 people each . think for a moment what would happen if they got 20 people to participate ! most people get 100 ' s of participants . think about it ! for every $ 5 . 00 you receive , all you must do is e - mail them the report they ordered . that ' s it ! always provide same - day service on all orders ! this will guarantee that the e - mail they send out with your name and address on it will be prompt because they can ' t advertise until they receive the report ! available reports * * * order each report by number , and name * * * * always send $ 5 cash ( u . s . currency ) for each report . checks not accepted * - always send your order via first class mail - make sure the cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least two sheets of paper ( so that the bill can ' t be seen against light ) on one of those sheets of paper include : ( a ) the number & name of the report you are ordering , ( b ) your e - mail address , and ( c ) your name & postal address ( in case your e - mail provider encounters problems ) . place your order for these reports now : report # 1 "" the insiders guide to advertizing for free on the internet "" order report # 1 from : randy dillard p . o . box 8 osprey , fl 34229 usa report # 2 "" the insiders guide to sending bulk email on the internet "" order report # 2 from : carla brown p . o . box 39093 sarasota , fl 34238 usa report # 3 "" the secrets to multilevel marketing on the internet "" order report # 3 from : glynn schmidt p . o . box 19424 sarasota , fl 34276 usa report # 4 ' how to become a millionaire utilizing the power of multilevel marketing and the internet "" order report # 4 from : christin joy cpo 2398 501 e . college avenue wheaton , il 60187 usa report # 5 "" how to send one million e - mails for free .

"re : uk power / gas vince , just fyi : oliver ( risk control in london ) was asking if it is appropriate to use a set of factors corresponding to some commodity for another commodity . this "" mapping "" we do quite frequently in our var system when forward prices for a commodity are not correlated ( because of poor price history ) . i think using this kind of mappings is ok because we can not trust these correlations based on illiquid price information . if we believed the matrix with low correlations represents what goes on in the market and we simply can not reconstruct it with our 7 factors - then we might use more factors then 7 or the matrix itself . tanya tanya tamarchenko 12 / 15 / 2000 02 : 36 pm to : oliver gaylard / lon / ect @ ect cc : david port / market risk / corp / enron @ enron , rudi zipter / hou / ect @ ect , wenyao jia / hou / ect @ ect , kirstee hewitt / lon / ect @ ect , debbie r brackett / hou / ect @ ect , naveen andrews / corp / enron @ enron subject : re : uk power / gas oliver , i completely agree with you : validating var inputs like positions , prices and volatilities which are used by risktrac is the first thing to do . you also rise a valid question : if the factor loadings for some commodity do not make sense should we use the factor loadings for another commodity ? the factor loadings "" do not make sense "" when the correlations across the term structure are not high . so if we believe that the forward prices for this commodity are market prices and statistical analysis on these prices produces the correlations which we trust , then it would be proper to use this correlation matrix in var engine , not the factors . using factors is simply the way to speed up calculations for highly correlated prices without sacrificing the accuracy . tanya . oliver gaylard 12 / 15 / 2000 07 : 11 am to : naveen andrews / corp / enron @ enron cc : david port / market risk / corp / enron @ enron , rudi zipter / hou / ect @ ect , wenyao jia / hou / ect @ ect , kirstee hewitt / lon / ect @ ect , tanya tamarchenko / hou / ect @ ect , ganapathy ramesh / hou / ect @ ect , debbie r brackett / hou / ect @ ect subject : re : uk power / gas naveen regarding the calculation of uk vars in risk trac i agree that we should be using this calculation engine for all commodity vars . however we should not focus solely on the uk but ensure that we use risk trac for continental power and gas , uk power and gas , nordic power . to use risk trac i think the following need to be resolved first , to implement it "" right the first time "" , as i think it is incorrect to consider the risk trac numbers "" as the most accurate "" since it depends on the validity of these items : positions ( delta and gamma ) and curve mapping - these need to include all positions including those outside the main risk systems positions , curves and mapping should now be no problem given the feeds , apart from continental power , have been uat ' d and we have the spreadsheet feeds up and running . price and vol curves - as used by the risk systems as above inter commodity correlation - prompt month correlation should be easy to calculate given an accurate and complete data set ( however the incomplete historic data for europe in risk trac , prior to the formation of the task force , would mean a full data set needs to be obtained and used ) . term structure of correlation would be good but i understand this is difficult to use in the calculation . factor loadings i think factor loadings should be calculated , on the same data sets used for inter commodity correlation , for all commodities . if this analysis does not appear to work i am not sure that using factor loadings for other markets is adequate . do we need to consider an alternative approach to calculating var for these markets ? to ensure this moves forward i think a list of the mile stones , responsibilities and time lines needs to be drawn up otherwise i fear the process of moving across to risk trac from the spreadsheet var will experience some slippage . i will call today to start the process off . rgds oliver naveen andrews @ enron 06 / 12 / 2000 21 : 50 to : oliver gaylard / lon / ect @ ect cc : david port / market risk / corp / enron @ enron , rudi zipter / hou / ect @ ect , wenyao jia / hou / ect @ ect , kirstee hewitt / lon / ect @ ect , tanya tamarchenko / hou / ect @ ect , ganapathy ramesh / hou / ect @ ect , debbie r brackett / hou / ect @ ect subject : uk power / gas oliver , i had a couple of issues pertaining to uk power / uk gas . first , just a few notes as it pertains to risk trac uk - implementation : ( 1 ) in risktrac , currently all the gas curves are mapped to nbp . ( 2 ) all the power curves are mapped to r 4 ( cinergy ) . factor loading analysis lends itself only to nbp and the norewgian curves ( for reasons of liquidity , etc ) . we have decided that nbp and cinergy are the best curves available at this time . the spreadsheet which is utilized in the uk also has curves mapped to a 2 - 3 - year old set of factors derived from us nat gas , which is clearly not optimal . hence ( 1 ) we should be using risktrac numbers for var , as it is the "" most accurate "" , both in terms of ene - wide model usage and in terms of the most recent updated data . ever since uk power came on board in risktrac 3 weeks ago , the uk power number has been consistently 7 - 8 mm above the numbers in your spreadsheet . this difference is to be ecpected , given the different inputs . ( 2 ) the consistent numbers do not point to a data error in any obvious way , however , if you believe that positions are not captured correctly , please let our it staff know that .

"california power 1 / 19 / 00 executive summary : sb - 7 x gives dept . of water and resources given legislative authority to undertake short - term power purchases with no price cap through feb . 2 nd new legislation ( ab - 1 x and sb - 6 x ) would seek ( 1 ) long - term contracts with 5 . 5 cent cap and ( 2 ) creation of california power and conservation financing authority the long - term contracts proposed in ab - 1 x are likely to be subject to significant amendment and renegotiation prior to the feb . 2 nd expiration of sb - 7 x . the authority proposed in sb - 6 x would have bond issuance powers to finance new generation capacity and conservation measures negotiations under way on using bond authority for a utility bailout - - utilities and state government split over debt obligations of utility parents state borrowing plans and power purchases create credit risks for state treasury ; socal edison misses more payments bush administration opposes price caps , but is supporting state efforts to split pg we believe he then could be willing to guarantee or issue bonds to deal with the rest . as one very senior california political leader explained , getting the utility holding companies to eat a substantial part of the debt they owe themselves is the key to solving the back debt problem without provoking widespread public outrage about a "" bailout "" of private price - gouging companies with taxpayer money . since 75 % of californians currently blame the utilities and the puc for this crisis ( and only 10 % blame davis ) , this is a crucial political stance for the governor . but , of course , absorbing anything like $ 6 billion in debt would be quite a shock to the seemingly healthy holding company and power - generating branches of the two utilities , and they began spreading the word that they were quite willing to accept bankruptcy . thus by mid - week , both sides had pushed themselves toward a resolution in federal bankruptcy court that would be a worst case solution for all sides : the country ' s economy would suffer from the resulting credit shock , the governor ' s political future would suffer from the electricity rate increases almost certain to be mandated by a bankruptcy judge , while most private sector legal authorities believe the utilities corporate holding structure would ultimately be breached during bankruptcy procedures and they would end up having to absorb some significant amount of the debt in the end . in addition , they would most likely face a state government determined to use state powers of condemnation to enter the power business in a major way . senator burton ' s sb 6 x legislation will strengthen those powers dramatically to make this point quite explicit . it would set up a "" california power and conservation financing authority , "" with the power to issue bonds and invoke eminent domain . it would finance new power plants , and "" consider the feasibility and public interest of the state acquiring , operating , and maintaining transmission facilities currently owned by investor - owned and municipal utilities . "" as we write this , all sides are trying to construct a path back down from the bankruptcy ledge to safe ground , and there is no question the tone has shifted in the last 24 hours from macho confrontation to "" maybe we ' ve run this thing out as far as we can . "" but as we have noted , the chance for miscalculation is still quite high . there is no solution agreed to at this time , the stand - off over how much debt the state government will absorb versus the utilities ' holding company is continuing , and the technical fact of default still makes it possible for some bank to trigger bankruptcy by demanding immediate accelerated payment . 5 . default update - thursday socal edison - $ 215 million default to california power exchange . after edison failed to make a $ 215 m electricity payment yesterday , the california power authority began seizing long - term contacts and reselling them to recoup some of the money owed to generators . pg & e said it expects its trading privileges at the cal . power authority to be suspended today , leaving them with only its generation from nuclear and hydroelectric sources . while the ongoing wave of defaults has severely restricted pg & e ' s and socal ' s ability to buy power , the department of water and resources will be able to pick up some of the slack , at least in the very short - term . the state itself may be getting into risky credit territory . the proposed california public power authority would borrow in the neighborhood of $ 1 . 3 billion from the state general fund in advance of this year ' s expected fiscal surplus , with the loan to be repaid by the authority from expected future revenues . with near - bankrupt utilities and a freeze on rate hikes , it is unclear where the revenues would come from . the amount borrowed and terms of repayment will be no doubt examined very carefully by the bond rating agencies . 5 . bush policies as we reported on wednesday , the bush administration continues to demonstrate little interest in getting involved in the california crisis . president - elect bush surprised state leaders yesterday with his comments , which essentially said that excessive environmental regulation was the root of the current supply shortage . bush and his top officials appear to be unanimously opposed to long - term price caps . however , there is one issue of considerable importance to the administration , according to a source close to a top bush economic advisor . there is significant concern that pg & e ' s credit problems could cause gas suppliers to stop shipments of gas through pg & e ' s pipeline . the risk would be that the pipeline could "" go dry "" , causing significant and possibly dangerous disruptions in california residences and businesses . to prevent this problem , bush is working with davis on a proposal to split pg & e into separate gas and electric companies . the gas company would be solvent , but the electric company would go immediately into ch . 11 following significant defaults .",0,california power executive

"re : pre - submitted question on espeak erin , a book by martha amram and nalin kulatilaka is an excellent non - technical introduction to real options and it contains all the most important references to more advanced books and papers . the book has an endorsement by jeff skilling on the cover page . the research group offered several one - day seminars on real options and applications to the energy industry . we still have a few binders with the presentation materials available if you are interested . we plan to repeat the seminar sometimes in the fall . the first part of the seminar ( about 4 hours in the morning ) covers general concept of real options and their applicability to the energy business . the second , more technical afternoon session , covers stochastic processes used to model price uncertainty in the energy markets and specific case studies ( valuation of natural gas storage facilities and of peaking gas - fired power plants ) . the real options approach has been developed specifically to address the problem of making investment decisions under uncertainty . nobody in this field claims that this is a perfect tool , but it represents a significant progress compared to other techniques developed earlier . discounted cash flow analysis that tries to incorporate uncertainty through analysis of several , in most cases , arbitrary scenarios ( most likely , optimistic , pessimistic ) . these scenarios don ' t identify explicitly the risk drivers and don ' t specify the future proactive management decisions . the real , option approach is very powerful because it allows to ( 1 ) capture uncertainty in an explicit way and ( 2 ) to design investment projects that allow to exploit future positive developments and reduce future exposures to downside risk . this approach allows also create a link between investment decisions and future operational decisions . forward - looking investment decisions create options that are exercised in the future through active management of a project . the real options technology relies heavily on advanced statistical tools to come up with the representation of future possible states of the world . the real challenge is to use these tools in a sensible way . i have seen in my career ( almost 30 years of applying mathematical tools to business and economic problems ) many quants armed with powerful computers who reminded me of monkeys armed with hammers . the challenge is not to run mechanically thousands of simulations based on arbitrary assumptions but to translate in a creative way the insights of people who understand specific businesses into parsimonious quantitative models . it is especially critical to stress - test the assumptions of any model and to ask the question if the outcome of a model depends critically on any set of assumptions . if this is the case one should use common sense to examine the underlying assumptions . i remember that in the early eighties quite a few models simulated the dynamics of oil prices , but all the stochastic scenarios represented fluctuations around a very optimistic upward trend . one would have been better off stepping back and asking a simple question what economics 101 teaches about cartels and the dynamics of supply and demand . enron north america corp . from : erin rice @ enron 06 / 27 / 2000 03 : 52 pm to : vince j kaminski / hou / ect @ ect cc : subject : pre - submitted question on espeak good news ! there is already a question waiting for your july 12 espeak session . i have pasted it below , although you don ' t have to respond until the actual event . don ' t forget to send a bulleted list of discussion topics if you would still like us to advertise the event on the elevator screens . thanks . - er submitted by breineck i was doing some reading about the application of real options in the evaluation of non - financial assets . would you recommend any texts or articles for a more in - depth study of this area ?

"alliance info alert : richardson and ferc orders dear generation / power marketing executive : the following are summaries of two significant activities that occurred friday , december 15 1 . energy secretary richardson issuance of an emergency order . ( richardson ' s statement and fpa section 202 ( c ) order is posted on doe ' s web site at : http : / / www . energy . gov / hqpress / releaseso 0 / decpr / pro 0309 . html ) 2 . ferc ' s 12 / 15 / 00 final order to fix california wholesale markets ( ferc ' s order can be viewed at california supplies ordered by richardson o richardson orders listed entities to supply excess power to california iso o order is effective as soon as iso certifies shortage , but ends 12 / 21 / 00 , unless extended o prices to be agreed to by supplier and iso , or ferc will set rate later o fpa emergency power authority transferred to doe in 1977 as he said he would on december 13 , u . s . department of energy secretary bill richardson found "" an emergency exists in california by reason of the shortage of electric energy "" and issued an emergency order under section 202 ( c ) of the federal power act ( fpa ) requiring listed generators and marketers to provide any power in excess of the needs of their firm customers to the california iso . in a statement , richardson said the threat to the reliability of the california grid requires a long - term solution , but that in the short - term power must keep flowing to the state to avert blackouts . the 76 listed suppliers have 12 hours after the iso certifies to doe that it has been unable to acquire adequate supplies in the market to begin providing requested service to the iso . the iso must inform each supplier subject to the order of the amount and type of energy or services required by 9 : 00 pm , eastern standard time , the day before the services are needed . the order directs the iso to allocate , to the extent feasible , requested services among subject entities in proportion to each supplier ' s available excess power . the order is effective immediately and will terminate at 3 : 00 am , eastern time , december 21 , 2000 , unless extended . to continue to obtain supplies under this emergency authority , the iso must re - certify the shortage to doe headquarters every 24 hours . the terms of the provision of electric energy and other services by suppliers to the iso "" are to be agreed to by the parties . "" if no agreement is reached , then under the fpa ' s emergency authority secretary richardson "" will immediately prescribe the conditions of service and refer the rate issue to the federal energy regulatory commission for a determination at a later date by that agency in accordance with its standards and procedures , and will prescribe by supplemental order such rates as it finds to be just and reasonable . "" the authority of ferc to set rates for power supplied under emergency order at just and reasonable levels where the parties themselves do not agree to a rate is explicitly included in fpa section 202 ( c ) . the doe organization act of 1997 transferred the emergency powers of this section from ferc to doe . the 76 entities identified in the order ' s attachment are all the entities that have provided power to the iso over the last 30 days . those entities are ordered "" to make arrangements to generate , deliver , interchange , and transmit electric energy when , as , and in such amounts as may be requested by the "" iso , "" acting as agent for and on behalf of scheduling coordinators . "" [ source : doe secretary richardson ' s december 14 , 2000 statement and order ; electric power daily , december 15 , 2000 ] ferc de - federalizes california markets , adopts other structural reforms a summary of the december 15 order and commission discussion at its special meeting today , ferc unanimously approved its eagerly awaited final order reforming the california wholesale markets , adopting the major outlines of its november 1 proposed order and sending back to california the responsibility for addressing state - related matters , as discussed below . at the same time , ferc deferred consideration of retroactive refund issues as well as the imposition of region - wide price caps . ferc reiterated the november 1 conclusions that under certain circumstances , california ratepayers were subjected to unjust and unreasonable power rates due to california ' s "" seriously flawed "" market structure and rules in conjunction with tight demand and supply conditions throughout the west . while all four commissioners supported the order as a consensus - based outcome that appropriately balanced all competing interests , each commissioner expressed reservations with particular aspects of the order . chairman hoecker and comm . breathitt expressed the strongest endorsement , while comms . hebert and massey laid out their positions where they believed the commission had either "" over - reached "" or not gone far enough , just as they did on november 1 , as discussed below . highlights of key actions : ( 1 ) ferc adopted the november 1 proposal to eliminate , effective immediately , the state ' s mandatory requirement that the state ' s investor - owned utilities buy and sell electricity through the px , and allow these utilities to purchase electricity through forward contracts and other alternative mechanisms to manage supply risks . ferc terminated the px ' s rate schedules effective at the close of business on april 30 , 2001 . in effect , as chairman hoecker stated , the order de - federalizes 60 percent of the california wholesale market established under the state ' s restructuring law , returning ratemaking authority over company - owned generation to the california public utilities commission ( cpuc ) . ( 2 ) ferc modified the effective period of the november 1 $ 150 / mwh "" soft cap "" proposal , limiting its application through april 2001 , whereupon a "" comprehensive and systematic monitoring and mitigation program which incorporates appropriate thresholds , screen and mitigation measures "" must be in place . in a related move , ferc ordered a technical conference early next year to develop such a program by march 1 , 2001 , so that these measures can be place by the may 1 , deadline . in a major modification , ferc revised the refund conditions to clarify that while certain refund conditions will continue to apply , unless ferc issues written notification to the seller that its transaction is still under review , refund potential on a transaction will close after 60 days . as proposed , however , supply bids in excess of $ 150 will be prohibited from setting the market - clearing price for all bidders and sellers bidding above $ 150 / mwh will be required to report their bids to ferc on a confidential , weekly basis and provide certain cost support . ( 3 ) ferc adopted the november 1 proposal to require the establishment of independent , non - stakeholder governing board for the iso . the iso governing board must relinquish their decision - making power and operating control to the iso management on january 29 , 2001 . a future order will set procedures for discussion with state representatives on the board selection process . ( 4 ) in a major modification , ferc adopted a $ 74 / mwh "" price benchmark "" for assessing prices of five - year energy supply contracts . this benchmark will be used in assessing any complaints regarding justness and reasonableness of pricing long - term contracts . to facilitate prompt negotiation of longer term power contracts at reasonable rates , ferc announced that it will hold a settlement conference with market participants . ( 5 ) ferc adopted the november 1 proposal to require market participants to schedule 95 percent of their transactions in the day - ahead market and instituting a penalty charge for under - scheduling ( in excess of five percent of hourly load requirements ) , in order to discourage over - reliance on the real - time spot market . ( 6 ) ferc directed the iso and the three investor - owned utilities to file generation interconnection standards . ( 7 ) ferc affirmed the longer - term measures proposed in the november 1 order , including submission of a congestion management design proposal by april 2 , 2001 . ( 8 ) ferc deferred resolving key issues , including establishing new iso board selection procedures , developing appropriate market monitoring measures and negotiating protective orders associated with data collection . ( 9 ) ferc reiterated its november 1 call to california policy makers there to resolve state issues , such as : ( 1 ) immediately implementing the availability of day ahead markets for power purchases ; ( 2 ) development of demand responses ; ( 3 ) siting of generation and transmission ; and ( 4 ) assurance of sufficient reserve requirements . commissioner responses comm . hebert reluctantly concurred , calling the final order a "" missed opportunity "" to , among other things , send appropriate signals for new generation siting and conservation . reiterating his november 1 concerns , hebert recounted the remedial remedies that he maintained the commission should and should not have adopted . while expressing pleasure at the tone of the order ( "" balanced and considerate "" ) , the bid certainly reversal , and the role reserved for the state in the selection of the new iso board , hebert nonetheless objected to the benchmark prices established in the order , which he maintained appeared to be unreasonably low . hebert faulted the commission for not attempting to reconcile the instant order with the november 8 order approving the ca iso ' s emergency $ 250 / mwh "" soft cap "" proposal . hebert ended by challenging the cpuc to do what it can to encourage utilities there to forward contract , including easing the existing prudence review requirements . comm . breathitt endorsed the order , reiterating her support for progress towards open and competitive markets . she noted that the order properly "" walked the line "" by taking all of the competing interests into account , calling it less than ideal , but a step in the right direction . she also concentrated her remarks on the importance of creating stability which will be accomplished by encouraging long term contracts and the implementation of the $ 150 / mwh breakpoint . additionally she mentioned that any price below the $ 74 / mwh benchmark will be presumed just and reasonable . comm . massey concurred , but prefaced his remarks by expressing sympathy for california ratepayers , stating that he felt that market power had been exercised , that prices were not just and reasonable and that the marketers had profited too much at the expense of others in the market . he warned that , as he understood the legal precedents , the federal courts were poised to grant cost recovery relief to the retailers which would then be passed on to consumers . on the positive side , he approved of the de - federalization of 60 % of the market and the creation of long term contracts . however , he emphasized that california regulators must now take the responsibility of creating more generation and transmission . in the long term , comm . massey hoped that solutions could be reached starting with a technical conference and that the market would have rules more like pjm . finally , comm . massey articulated what he would have liked to have done differently . he stated that he disagreed with the fact that there is not enough evidence to show that market power existed and he pointed to the on - going investigation . he also disagreed with the $ 150 / mwh breakpoint , preferring instead a hard price per generator . the commissioner said he would have set the long term benchmark for only two years instead of five and that he would have opened a section 206 investigation in the west . finally , he stated that he would have liked to address the issue of refunds . chairman hoecker began his comments by saying that the commission was forced to act and act quickly because the stakes are so high . he feels that it is now time for the state regulators and markets to act . he noted that by shrinking the cal px , the responsibility is now with the cpuc to fashion the long term contracts and that hopefully we will exit this situation with the least amount of damage to the utilities . in regards to suggestions for a regional price cap , the chairman stated that this would not work due to the fact that the commission has no jurisdiction over bonneville , wapa and the public power producers and that there is no spot market in the northwest . however , he did urge secretary richardson to convene a conference in order to address regional issues . finally , in conceptually addressing the california situation , the chairman stated that competition or "" deregulation "" did not fail in california , but that there never was competition in california .",0,alliance info alert richardson ferc orders dear generation power marketing
